J.K. ROWLING - HARRY POTTER 

THE OTHER MINISTER 

It was nearing midnight and the Prime Minister was 
sitting alone in his office, reading a long memo that 
was slipping through his brain without leaving the 
slightest trace of meaning behind. He was waiting for 
a call from the President of a far distant country, and 
between wondering when the wretched man would 
telephone, and trying to suppress unpleasant 
memories of what had been a very long, tiring, and 
difficult week, there was not much space in his head 
for anything else. The more he attempted to focus on 
the print on the page before him, the more clearly the 
Prime Minister could see the gloating face of one of 
his political opponents. This particular opponent had 
appeared on the news that very day, not only to 
enumerate all the terrible things that had happened 
in the last week (as though anyone needed reminding) 
but also to explain why each and every one of them 
was the government’s fault. 

The Prime Minister’s pulse quickened at the very 
thought of these accusations, for they were neither 
fair nor true. How on earth was his government 

Page | 2 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 



supposed to have stopped that bridge collapsing? It 
was outrageous for anybody to suggest that they were 
not spending enough on bridges. The bridge was 
fewer than ten years old, and the best experts were at 
a loss to explain why it had snapped cleanly in two, 
sending a dozen cars into the watery depths of the 
river below. And how dare anyone suggest that it was 
lack of policemen that had resulted in those two very 
nasty and well-publicized murders? Or that the 
government should have somehow foreseen the freak 
hurricane in the West Country that had caused so 
much damage to both people and property? And was 
it his fault that one of his Junior Ministers, Herbert 
Chorley, had chosen this week to act so peculiarly 
that he was now going to be spending a lot more time 
with his family? 

“A grim mood has gripped the country,” the opponent 
had concluded, barely concealing his own broad grin. 

And unfortunately, this was perfectly true. The Prime 
Minister felt it himself; people really did seem more 
miserable than usual. Even the weather was dismal; 
all this chilly mist in the middle of July. ... It wasn’t 
right, it wasn’t normal. ... 

He turned over the second page of the memo, saw 
how much longer it went on, and gave it up as a bad 
job. Stretching his arms above his head he looked 
around his office mournfully. It was a handsome 
room, with a fine marble fireplace facing the long sash 
windows, firmly closed against the unseasonable 
chill. With a slight shiver, the Prime Minister got up 
and moved over to the window, looking out at the thin 
mist that was pressing itself against the glass. It was 
then, as he stood with his back to the room, that he 
heard a soft cough behind him. 



Page | 3 



Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




He froze, nose to nose with his own scared-looking 
reflection in the dark glass. He knew that cough. He 
had heard it before. He turned very slowly to face the 
empty room. 

“Hello?” he said, trying to sound braver than he felt. 

For a brief moment he allowed himself the impossible 
hope that nobody would answer him. However, a 
voice responded at once, a crisp, decisive voice that 
sounded as though it were reading a prepared 
statement. It was coming — as the Prime Minister 
had known at the first cough — from the froglike little 
man wearing a long silver wig who was depicted in a 
small, dirty oil painting in the far corner of the room. 

“To the Prime Minister of Muggles. Urgent we meet. 
Kindly respond immediately. Sincerely, Fudge.” 

The man in the painting looked inquiringly at the 
Prime Minister. 

“Er,” said the Prime Minister, “listen. ... It’s not a very 
good time for me. ... I’m waiting for a telephone call, 
you see . . . from the President of — ” 

“That can be rearranged,” said the portrait at once. 
The Prime Minister’s heart sank. He had been afraid 
of that. 

“But I really was rather hoping to speak — ” 

“We shall arrange for the President to forget to call. 

He will telephone tomorrow night instead,” said the 
little man. “Kindly respond immediately to Mr. 

Fudge.” 

“I ... oh ... very well,” said the Prime Minister weakly. 
“Yes, I’ll see Fudge.” 

Page | 4 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling 




He hurried back to his desk, straightening his tie as 
he went. He had barely resumed his seat, and 
arranged his face into what he hoped was a relaxed 
and unfazed expression, when bright green flames 
burst into life in the empty grate beneath his marble 
mantelpiece. He watched, trying not to betray a flicker 
of surprise or alarm, as a portly man appeared within 
the flames, spinning as fast as a top. Seconds later, 
he had climbed out onto a rather fine antique rug, 
brushing ash from the sleeves of his long pin-striped 
cloak, a lime-green bowler hat in his hand. 

“Ah ... Prime Minister,” said Cornelius Fudge, striding 
forward with his hand outstretched. “Good to see you 
again.” 

The Prime Minister could not honestly return this 
compliment, so said nothing at all. He was not 
remotely pleased to see Fudge, whose occasional 
appearances, apart from being downright alarming in 
themselves, generally meant that he was about to 
hear some very bad news. Furthermore, Fudge was 
looking distinctly careworn. He was thinner, balder, 
and grayer, and his face had a crumpled look. The 
Prime Minister had seen that kind of look in 
politicians before, and it never boded well. 

“How can I help you?” he said, shaking Fudge’s hand 
very briefly and gesturing toward the hardest of the 
chairs in front of the desk. 

“Difficult to know where to begin,” muttered Fudge, 
pulling up the chair, sitting down, and placing his 
green bowler upon his knees. “What a week, what a 
week ...” 

“Had a bad one too, have you?” asked the Prime 
Minister stiffly, hoping to convey by this that he had 



Page | 5 



Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




quite enough on his plate already without any extra 
helpings from Fudge. 



“Yes, of course,” said Fudge, rubbing his eyes wearily 
and looking morosely at the Prime Minister. “I’ve been 
having the same week you have, Prime Minister. The 
Brockdale Bridge ... the Bones and Vance murders ... 
not to mention the ruckus in the West Country ...” 

“You — er — your — I mean to say, some of your 
people were — were involved in those — those things, 
were they?” 

Fudge fixed the Prime Minister with a rather stern 
look. “Of course they were,” he said. “Surely you’ve 
realized what’s going on?” 

“I ...” hesitated the Prime Minister. 

It was precisely this sort of behavior that made him 
dislike Fudge’s visits so much. He was, after all, the 
Prime Minister and did not appreciate being made to 
feel like an ignorant schoolboy. But of course, it had 
been like this from his very first meeting with Fudge 
on his very first evening as Prime Minister. He 
remembered it as though it were yesterday and knew 
it would haunt him until his dying day. 

He had been standing alone in this very office, 
savoring the triumph that was his after so many 
years of dreaming and scheming, when he had heard 
a cough behind him, just like tonight, and turned to 
find that ugly little portrait talking to him, 
announcing that the Minister of Magic was about to 
arrive and introduce himself. 

Naturally, he had thought that the long campaign and 
the strain of the election had caused him to go mad. 
He had been utterly terrified to find a portrait talking 

Page | 6 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling 




to him, though this had been nothing to how he felt 
when a self-proclaimed wizard had bounced out of the 
fireplace and shaken his hand. He had remained 
speechless throughout Fudge’s kindly explanation 
that there were witches and wizards still living in 
secret all over the world and his reassurances that he 
was not to bother his head about them as the 
Ministry of Magic took responsibility for the whole 
Wizarding community and prevented the non-magical 
population from getting wind of them. It was, said 
Fudge, a difficult job that encompassed everything 
from regulations on responsible use of broomsticks to 
keeping the dragon population under control (the 
Prime Minister remembered clutching the desk for 
support at this point). Fudge had then patted the 
shoulder of the still-dumbstruck Prime Minister in a 
fatherly sort of way. 

“Not to worry,” he had said, “it’s odds-on you’ll never 
see me again. I’ll only bother you if there’s something 
really serious going on our end, something that’s 
likely to affect the Muggles — the non-magical 
population, I should say. Otherwise, it’s live and let 
live. And I must say, you’re taking it a lot better than 
your predecessor. He tried to throw me out the 
window, thought I was a hoax planned by the 
opposition.” 

At this, the Prime Minister had found his voice at last. 
“You’re — you’re not a hoax, then?” 

It had been his last, desperate hope. 

“No,” said Fudge gently. “No, I’m afraid I’m not. Look.” 

And he had turned the Prime Minister’s teacup into a 
gerbil. 



Page | 7 



Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“But,” said the Prime Minister breathlessly, watching 
his teacup chewing on the corner of his next speech, 
“but why — why has nobody told me — ?” 

“The Minister of Magic only reveals him- or herself to 
the Muggle Prime Minister of the day,” said Fudge, 
poking his wand back inside his jacket. “We find it 
the best way to maintain secrecy.” 

“But then,” bleated the Prime Minister, “why hasn’t a 
former Prime Minister warned me — ?” 

At this, Fudge had actually laughed. 

“My dear Prime Minister, are you ever going to tell 
anybody?” 

Still chortling, Fudge had thrown some powder into 
the fireplace, stepped into the emerald flames, and 
vanished with a whooshing sound. The Prime 
Minister had stood there, quite motionless, and 
realized that he would never, as long as he lived, dare 
mention this encounter to a living soul, for who in the 
wide world would believe him? 

The shock had taken a little while to wear off. For a 
time, he had tried to convince himself that Fudge had 
indeed been a hallucination brought on by lack of 
sleep during his grueling election campaign. In a vain 
attempt to rid himself of all reminders of this 
uncomfortable encounter, he had given the gerbil to 
his delighted niece and instructed his private 
secretary to take down the portrait of the ugly little 
man who had announced Fudge’s arrival. To the 
Prime Minister’s dismay, however, the portrait had 
proved impossible to remove. When several 
carpenters, a builder or two, an art historian, and the 
Chancellor of the Exchequer had all tried 
unsuccessfully to prise it from the wall, the Prime 
Page | 8 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Minister had abandoned the attempt and simply 
resolved to hope that the thing remained motionless 
and silent for the rest of his term in office. 
Occasionally he could have sworn he saw out of the 
corner of his eye the occupant of the painting 
yawning, or else scratching his nose; even, once or 
twice, simply walking out of his frame and leaving 
nothing but a stretch of muddy-brown canvas behind. 
However, he had trained himself not to look at the 
picture very much, and always to tell himself firmly 
that his eyes were playing tricks on him when 
anything like this happened. 

Then, three years ago, on a night very like tonight, the 
Prime Minister had been alone in his office when the 
portrait had once again announced the imminent 
arrival of Fudge, who had burst out of the fireplace, 
sopping wet and in a state of considerable panic. 
Before the Prime Minister could ask why he was 
dripping all over the Axminster, Fudge had started 
ranting about a prison the Prime Minister had never 
heard of, a man named “Serious” Black, something 
that sounded like “Hogwarts,” and a boy called Harry 
Potter, none of which made the remotest sense to the 
Prime Minister. 

"... Fve just come from Azkaban,” Fudge had panted, 
tipping a large amount of water out of the rim of his 
bowler hat into his pocket. “Middle of the North Sea, 
you know, nasty flight . . . the dementors are in 
uproar” — he shuddered — “they’ve never had a 
breakout before. Anyway, I had to come to you, Prime 
Minister. Black’s a known Muggle killer and may be 
planning to rejoin You-Know-Who. ... But of course, 
you don’t even know who You-Know-Who is!” He had 
gazed hopelessly at the Prime Minister for a moment, 
then said, “Well, sit down, sit down, I’d better fill you 
in. ... Have a whiskey ...” 



Page | 9 



Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




The Prime Minister rather resented being told to sit 
down in his own office, let alone offered his own 
whiskey, but he sat nevertheless. Fudge pulled out 
his wand, conjured two large glasses full of amber 
liquid out of thin air, pushed one of them into the 
Prime Minister’s hand, and drew up a chair. 

Fudge had talked for more than an hour. At one 
point, he had refused to say a certain name aloud and 
wrote it instead on a piece of parchment, which he 
had thrust into the Prime Minister’s whiskey-free 
hand. When at last Fudge had stood up to leave, the 
Prime Minister had stood up too. 

“So you think that ...” He had squinted down at the 
name in his left hand. “Lord Vol — ” 

“ He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named\” snarled Fudge. 

“I’m sorry. ... You think that He-Who-Must-Not-Be- 
Named is still alive, then?” 

“Well, Dumbledore says he is,” said Fudge, as he had 
fastened his pin-striped cloak under his chin, “but 
we’ve never found him. If you ask me, he’s not 
dangerous unless he’s got support, so it’s Black we 
ought to be worrying about. You’ll put out that 
warning, then? Excellent. Well, I hope we don’t see 
each other again, Prime Minister! Good night.” 

But they had seen each other again. Less than a year 
later a harassed-looking Fudge had appeared out of 
thin air in the cabinet room to inform the Prime 
Minister that there had been a spot of bother at the 
Kwidditch (or that was what it had sounded like) 
World Cup and that several Muggles had been 
“involved,” but that the Prime Minister was not to 
worry, the fact that You-Know- Who’s Mark had been 
seen again meant nothing; Fudge was sure it was an 
Page | 10 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




isolated incident, and the Muggle Liaison Office was 
dealing with all memory modifications as they spoke. 

“Oh, and I almost forgot,” Fudge had added. “We’re 
importing three foreign dragons and a sphinx for the 
Triwizard Tournament, quite routine, but the 
Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical 
Creatures tells me that it’s down in the rule book that 
we have to notify you if we’re bringing highly 
dangerous creatures into the country.” 

“I — what — dragons?” spluttered the Prime Minister. 

“Yes, three,” said Fudge. “And a sphinx. Well, good 
day to you.” 

The Prime Minister had hoped beyond hope that 
dragons and sphinxes would be the worst of it, but 
no. Less than two years later, Fudge had erupted out 
of the fire yet again, this time with the news that 
there had been a mass breakout from Azkaban. 

“A mass breakout?” repeated the Prime Minister 
hoarsely. 

“No need to worry, no need to worry!” shouted Fudge, 
already with one foot in the flames. “We’ll have them 
rounded up in no time — just thought you ought to 
know!” 

And before the Prime Minister could shout, “Now, wait 
just one moment!” Fudge had vanished in a shower of 
green sparks. 

Whatever the press and the opposition might say, the 
Prime Minister was not a foolish man. It had not 
escaped his notice that, despite Fudge’s assurances 
at their first meeting, they were now seeing rather a 
lot of each other, nor that Fudge was becoming more 
Page | 11 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




flustered with each visit. Little though he liked to 
think about the Minister of Magic (or, as he always 
called Fudge in his head, the Other Minister), the 
Prime Minister could not help but fear that the next 
time Fudge appeared it would be with graver news 
still. The sight, therefore, of Fudge stepping out of the 
fire once more, looking disheveled and fretful and 
sternly surprised that the Prime Minister did not 
know exactly why he was there, was about the worst 
thing that had happened in the course of this 
extremely gloomy week. 

“How should I know what’s going on in the — er — 
Wizarding community?” snapped the Prime Minister 
now. “I have a country to run and quite enough 
concerns at the moment without — ” 

“We have the same concerns,” Fudge interrupted. 

“The Brockdale Bridge didn’t wear out. That wasn’t 
really a hurricane. Those murders were not the work 
of Muggles. And Herbert Chorley’s family would be 
safer without him. We are currently making 
arrangements to have him transferred to St. Mungo’s 
Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. The move 
should be effected tonight.” 

“What do you ... I’m afraid I ... What?” blustered the 
Prime Minister. 

Fudge took a great, deep breath and said, “Prime 
Minister, I am very sorry to have to tell you that he’s 
back. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back.” 

“Back? When you say ‘back’ ... he’s alive? I mean — ” 

The Prime Minister groped in his memory for the 
details of that horrible conversation of three years 
previously, when Fudge had told him about the 
wizard who was feared above all others, the wizard 

Page | 12 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




who had committed a thousand terrible crimes before 
his mysterious disappearance fifteen years earlier. 

“Yes, alive,” said Fudge. “That is — I don’t know — is 
a man alive if he can’t be killed? I don’t really 
understand it, and Dumbledore won’t explain 
properly — but anyway, he’s certainly got a body and 
is walking and talking and killing, so I suppose, for 
the purposes of our discussion, yes, he’s alive.” 

The Prime Minister did not know what to say to this, 
but a persistent habit of wishing to appear well- 
informed on any subject that came up made him cast 
around for any details he could remember of their 
previous conversations. 

“Is Serious Black with — er — He-Who-Must-Not-Be- 
Named?” 

“Black? Black?” said Fudge distractedly, turning his 
bowler rapidly in his fingers. “Sirius Black, you 
mean? Merlin’s beard, no. Black’s dead. Turns out we 
were — er — mistaken about Black. He was innocent 
after all. And he wasn’t in league with He-Who-Must- 
Not-Be-Named either. I mean,” he added defensively, 
spinning the bowler hat still faster, “all the evidence 
pointed — we had more than fifty eyewitnesses — but 
anyway, as I say, he’s dead. Murdered, as a matter of 
fact. On Ministry of Magic premises. There’s going to 
be an inquiry, actually. ...” 

To his great surprise, the Prime Minister felt a fleeting 
stab of pity for Fudge at this point. It was, however, 
eclipsed almost immediately by a glow of smugness at 
the thought that, deficient though he himself might 
be in the area of materializing out of fireplaces, there 
had never been a murder in any of the government 
departments under his charge. ... Not yet, anyway ... 



Page | 13 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




While the Prime Minister surreptitiously touched the 
wood of his desk, Fudge continued, “But Black’s by- 
the-by now. The point is, we’re at war, Prime Minister, 
and steps must be taken.” 

“At war?” repeated the Prime Minister nervously. 
“Surely that’s a little bit of an overstatement?” 

“He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has now been joined by 
those of his followers who broke out of Azkaban in 
January,” said Fudge, speaking more and more 
rapidly and twirling his bowler so fast that it was a 
lime-green blur. “Since they have moved into the 
open, they have been wreaking havoc. The Brockdale 
Bridge — he did it, Prime Minister, he threatened a 
mass Muggle killing unless I stood aside for him and 



“Good grief, so it’s your fault those people were killed 
and I’m having to answer questions about rusted 
rigging and corroded expansion joints and I don’t 
know what else!” said the Prime Minister furiously. 

“My fault!” said Fudge, coloring up. “Are you saying 
you would have caved in to blackmail like that?” 

“Maybe not,” said the Prime Minister, standing up 
and striding about the room, “but I would have put all 
my efforts into catching the blackmailer before he 
committed any such atrocity!” 

“Do you really think I wasn’t already making every 
effort?” demanded Fudge heatedly. “Every Auror in 
the Ministry was — and is — trying to find him and 
round up his followers, but we happen to be talking 
about one of the most powerful wizards of all time, a 
wizard who has eluded capture for almost three 
decades!” 



Page | 14 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“So I suppose you’re going to tell me he caused the 
hurricane in the West Country too?” said the Prime 
Minister, his temper rising with every pace he took. It 
was infuriating to discover the reason for all these 
terrible disasters and not to be able to tell the public, 
almost worse than it being the government’s fault 
after all. 

“That was no hurricane,” said Fudge miserably. 

“Excuse me!” barked the Prime Minister, now 
positively stamping up and down. “Trees uprooted, 
roofs ripped off, lampposts bent, horrible injuries — ” 

“It was the Death Eaters,” said Fudge. “He-Who-Must- 
Not-Be-Named’s followers. And ... and we suspect 
giant involvement.” 

The Prime Minister stopped in his tracks as though 
he had hit an invisible wall. “ What involvement?” 

Fudge grimaced. “He used giants last time, when he 
wanted to go for the grand effect,” he said. “The Office 
of Misinformation has been working around the clock, 
we’ve had teams of Obliviators out trying to modify 
the memories of all the Muggles who saw what really 
happened, we’ve got most of the Department for the 
Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures running 
around Somerset, but we can’t find the giant — it’s 
been a disaster.” 

“You don’t say!” said the Prime Minister furiously. 

“I won’t deny that morale is pretty low at the 
Ministry,” said Fudge. “What with all that, and then 
losing Amelia Bones.” 

“Losing who?” 



Page | 15 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Amelia Bones. Head of the Department of Magical 
Law Enforcement. We think He-Who-Must-Not-Be- 
Named may have murdered her in person, because 
she was a very gifted witch and — and all the 
evidence was that she put up a real fight.” 

Fudge cleared his throat and, with an effort, it 
seemed, stopped spinning his bowler hat. 

“But that murder was in the newspapers,” said the 
Prime Minister, momentarily diverted from his anger. 
“Our newspapers. Amelia Bones ... it just said she 
was a middle-aged woman who lived alone. It was a — 
a nasty killing, wasn’t it? It’s had rather a lot of 
publicity. The police are baffled, you see.” 

Fudge sighed. “Well, of course they are,” he said. 
“Killed in a room that was locked from the inside, 
wasn’t she? We, on the other hand, know exactly who 
did it, not that that gets us any further toward 
catching him. And then there was Emmeline Vance, 
maybe you didn’t hear about that one — ” 

“Oh yes I did!” said the Prime Minister. “It happened 
just around the corner from here, as a matter of fact. 
The papers had a field day with it, ‘breakdown of law 
and order in the Prime Minister’s backyard — ’ ” 

“And as if all that wasn’t enough,” said Fudge, barely 
listening to the Prime Minister, “we’ve got dementors 
swarming all over the place, attacking people left, 
right, and center. ...” 

Once upon a happier time this sentence would have 
been unintelligible to the Prime Minister, but he was 
wiser now. 

“I thought dementors guard the prisoners in 
Azkaban,” he said cautiously. 

Page | 16 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“They did,” said Fudge wearily. “But not anymore. 
They’ve deserted the prison and joined He-Who-Must- 
Not-Be-Named. I won’t pretend that wasn’t a blow.” 

“But,” said the Prime Minister, with a sense of 
dawning horror, “didn’t you tell me they’re the 
creatures that drain hope and happiness out of 
people?” 

“That’s right. And they’re breeding. That’s what’s 
causing all this mist.” 

The Prime Minister sank, weak-kneed, into the 
nearest chair. The idea of invisible creatures swooping 
through the towns and countryside, spreading 
despair and hopelessness in his voters, made him feel 
quite faint. 

“Now see here, Fudge — you’ve got to do something! 
It’s your responsibility as Minister of Magic!” 

“My dear Prime Minister, you can’t honestly think I’m 
still Minister of Magic after all this? I was sacked 
three days ago! The whole Wizarding community has 
been screaming for my resignation for a fortnight. I’ve 
never known them so united in my whole term of 
office!” said Fudge, with a brave attempt at a smile. 

The Prime Minister was momentarily lost for words. 
Despite his indignation at the position into which he 
had been placed, he still rather felt for the shrunken- 
looking man sitting opposite him. 

“I’m very sorry,” he said finally. “If there’s anything I 
can do?” 

“It’s very kind of you, Prime Minister, but there is 
nothing. I was sent here tonight to bring you up to 
date on recent events and to introduce you to my 

Page | 17 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




successor. I rather thought he’d be here by now, but 
of course, he’s very busy at the moment, with so 
much going on.” 

Fudge looked around at the portrait of the ugly little 
man wearing the long curly silver wig, who was 
digging in his ear with the point of a quill. Catching 
Fudge’s eye, the portrait said, “He’ll be here in a 
moment, he’s just finishing a letter to Dumbledore.” 

“I wish him luck,” said Fudge, sounding bitter for the 
first time. “I’ve been writing to Dumbledore twice a 
day for the past fortnight, but he won’t budge. If he’d 
just been prepared to persuade the boy, I might still 
be ... Well, maybe Scrimgeour will have more 
success.” 

Fudge subsided into what was clearly an aggrieved 
silence, but it was broken almost immediately by the 
portrait, which suddenly spoke in its crisp, official 
voice. 

“To the Prime Minister of Muggles. Requesting a 
meeting. Urgent. Kindly respond immediately. Rufus 
Scrimgeour, Minister of Magic.” 

“Yes, yes, fine,” said the Prime Minister distractedly, 
and he barely flinched as the flames in the grate 
turned emerald green again, rose up, and revealed a 
second spinning wizard in their heart, disgorging him 
moments later onto the antique rug. 

Fudge got to his feet and, after a moment’s hesitation, 
the Prime Minister did the same, watching the new 
arrival straighten up, dust down his long black robes, 
and look around. 

The Prime Minister’s first, foolish thought was that 
Rufus Scrimgeour looked rather like an old lion. 

Page | 18 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




There were streaks of gray in his mane of tawny hair 
and his bushy eyebrows; he had keen yellowish eyes 
behind a pair of wire-rimmed spectacles and a certain 
rangy, loping grace even though he walked with a 
slight limp. There was an immediate impression of 
shrewdness and toughness; the Prime Minister 
thought he understood why the Wizarding community 
preferred Scrimgeour to Fudge as a leader in these 
dangerous times. 

“How do you do?” said the Prime Minister politely, 
holding out his hand. 

Scrimgeour grasped it briefly, his eyes scanning the 
room, then pulled out a wand from under his robes. 

“Fudge told you everything?” he asked, striding over 
to the door and tapping the keyhole with his wand. 
The Prime Minister heard the lock click. 

“Er — yes,” said the Prime Minister. “And if you don’t 
mind, I’d rather that door remained unlocked.” 

“I’d rather not be interrupted,” said Scrimgeour 
shortly, “or watched,” he added, pointing his wand at 
the windows, so that the curtains swept across them. 
“Right, well, I’m a busy man, so let’s get down to 
business. First of all, we need to discuss your 
security.” 

The Prime Minister drew himself up to his fullest 
height and replied, “I am perfectly happy with the 
security I’ve already got, thank you very — ” 

“Well, we’re not,” Scrimgeour cut in. “It’ll be a poor 
lookout for the Muggles if their Prime Minister gets 
put under the Imperius Curse. The new secretary in 
your outer office — ”

‘Tm not getting rid of Kingsley Shacklebolt, if that’s 
what you’re suggesting!” said the Prime Minister 
hotly. “He’s highly efficient, gets through twice the 
work the rest of them — ” 

“That’s because he’s a wizard,” said Scrimgeour, 
without a flicker of a smile. “A highly trained Auror, 
who has been assigned to you for your protection.” 

“Now, wait a moment!” declared the Prime Minister. 
“You can’t just put your people into my office, I decide 
who works for me — ” 

“I thought you were happy with Shacklebolt?” said 
Scrimgeour coldly. 

“I am — that’s to say, I was — ” 

“Then there’s no problem, is there?” said Scrimgeour. 

“I ... well, as long as Shacklebolt’s work continues to 
be ... er ... excellent,” said the Prime Minister lamely, 
but Scrimgeour barely seemed to hear him. 

“Now, about Herbert Chorley, your Junior Minister,” 
he continued. “The one who has been entertaining the 
public by impersonating a duck.” 

“What about him?” asked the Prime Minister. 

“He has clearly reacted to a poorly performed 
Imperius Curse,” said Scrimgeour. “It’s addled his 
brains, but he could still be dangerous.” 

“He’s only quacking!” said the Prime Minister weakly. 
“Surely a bit of a rest . . . Maybe go easy on the drink 



Page | 20 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“A team of Healers from St. Mungo’s Hospital for 
Magical Maladies and Injuries are examining him as 
we speak. So far he has attempted to strangle three of 
them,” said Scrimgeour. “I think it best that we 
remove him from Muggle society for a while.” 

“I ... well ... He’ll be all right, won’t he?” said the 
Prime Minister anxiously. 

Scrimgeour merely shrugged, already moving back 
toward the fireplace. 

“Well, that’s really all I had to say. I will keep you 
posted of developments, Prime Minister — or, at least, 
I shall probably be too busy to come personally, in 
which case I shall send Fudge here. He has consented 
to stay on in an advisory capacity.” 

Fudge attempted to smile, but was unsuccessful; he 
merely looked as though he had a toothache. 
Scrimgeour was already rummaging in his pocket for 
the mysterious powder that turned the fire green. The 
Prime Minister gazed hopelessly at the pair of them 
for a moment, then the words he had fought to 
suppress all evening burst from him at last. 

“But for heaven’s sake — you’re wizards'. You can do 
magic ! Surely you can sort out — well — anything !” 

Scrimgeour turned slowly on the spot and exchanged 
an incredulous look with Fudge, who really did 
manage a smile this time as he said kindly, “The 
trouble is, the other side can do magic too, Prime 
Minister.” 

And with that, the two wizards stepped one after the 
other into the bright green fire and vanished.

SPINNER’S END 

Many miles away the chilly mist that had pressed 
against the Prime Minister’s windows drifted over a 
dirty river that wound between overgrown, rubbish- 
strewn banks. An immense chimney, relic of a 
disused mill, reared up, shadowy and ominous. There 
was no sound apart from the whisper of the black 
water and no sign of life apart from a scrawny fox that 
had slunk down the bank to nose hopefully at some 
old fish-and-chip wrappings in the tall grass. 

But then, with a very faint pop, a slim, hooded figure 
appeared out of thin air on the edge of the river. The 
fox froze, wary eyes fixed upon this strange new 
phenomenon. The figure seemed to take its bearings 
for a few moments, then set off with light, quick 
strides, its long cloak rustling over the grass. 

With a second and louder pop, another hooded figure 
materialized. 

“Wait!” 



Page | 22 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 



The harsh cry startled the fox, now crouching almost 
flat in the undergrowth. It leapt from its hiding place 
and up the bank. There was a flash of green light, a 
yelp, and the fox fell back to the ground, dead. 

The second figure turned over the animal with its toe. 

“Just a fox,” said a woman’s voice dismissively from 
under the hood. “I thought perhaps an Auror — 

Cissy, wait!” 

But her quarry, who had paused and looked back at 
the flash of light, was already scrambling up the bank 
the fox had just fallen down. 

“Cissy — Narcissa — listen to me — ” 

The second woman caught the first and seized her 
arm, but the other wrenched it away. 

“Go back, Bella!” 

“You must listen to me!” 

“I’ve listened already. I’ve made my decision. Leave me 
alone!” 

The woman named Narcissa gained the top of the 
bank, where a line of old railings separated the river 
from a narrow, cobbled street. The other woman, 

Bella, followed at once. Side by side they stood 
looking across the road at the rows and rows of 
dilapidated brick houses, their windows dull and 
blind in the darkness. 

“He lives here?” asked Bella in a voice of contempt. 
“Here? In this Muggle dunghill? We must be the first 
of our kind ever to set foot — ” 



Page | 23 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




But Narcissa was not listening; she had slipped 
through a gap in the rusty railings and was already 
hurrying across the road. 

“Cissy, wait\” 

Bella followed, her cloak streaming behind, and saw 
Narcissa darting through an alley between the houses 
into a second, almost identical street. Some of the 
streetlamps were broken; the two women were 
running between patches of light and deep darkness. 
The pursuer caught up with her prey just as she 
turned another corner, this time succeeding in 
catching hold of her arm and swinging her around so 
that they faced each other. 

“Cissy, you must not do this, you can’t trust him — ” 

“The Dark Lord trusts him, doesn’t he?” 

“The Dark Lord is ... I believe ... mistaken,” Bella 
panted, and her eyes gleamed momentarily under her 
hood as she looked around to check that they were 
indeed alone. “In any case, we were told not to speak 
of the plan to anyone. This is a betrayal of the Dark 
Lord’s — ” 

“Let go, Bella!” snarled Narcissa, and she drew a 
wand from beneath her cloak, holding it threateningly 
in the other’s face. Bella merely laughed. 

“Cissy, your own sister? You wouldn’t — ” 

“There is nothing I wouldn’t do anymore!” Narcissa 
breathed, a note of hysteria in her voice, and as she 
brought down the wand like a knife, there was 
another flash of light. Bella let go of her sister’s arm 
as though burned. 



Page | 24 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Narcisscd” 



But Narcissa had rushed ahead. Rubbing her hand, 
her pursuer followed again, keeping her distance now, 
as they moved deeper into the deserted labyrinth of 
brick houses. At last, Narcissa hurried up a street 
named Spinner’s End, over which the towering mill 
chimney seemed to hover like a giant admonitory 
finger. Her footsteps echoed on the cobbles as she 
passed boarded and broken windows, until she 
reached the very last house, where a dim light 
glimmered through the curtains in a downstairs 
room. 

She had knocked on the door before Bella, cursing 
under her breath, had caught up. Together they stood 
waiting, panting slightly, breathing in the smell of the 
dirty river that was carried to them on the night 
breeze. After a few seconds, they heard movement 
behind the door and it opened a crack. A sliver of a 
man could be seen looking out at them, a man with 
long black hair parted in curtains around a sallow 
face and black eyes. 

Narcissa threw back her hood. She was so pale that 
she seemed to shine in the darkness; the long blonde 
hair streaming down her back gave her the look of a 
drowned person. 

“Narcissa!” said the man, opening the door a little 
wider, so that the light fell upon her and her sister 
too. “What a pleasant surprise!” 

“Severus,” she said in a strained whisper. “May I 
speak to you? It’s urgent.” 

“But of course.” 



Page | 25 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




He stood back to allow her to pass him into the 
house. Her still-hooded sister followed without 
invitation. 

“Snape,” she said curtly as she passed him. 

“Bellatrix,” he replied, his thin mouth curling into a 
slightly mocking smile as he closed the door with a 
snap behind them. 

They had stepped directly into a tiny sitting room, 
which had the feeling of a dark, padded cell. The walls 
were completely covered in books, most of them 
bound in old black or brown leather; a threadbare 
sofa, an old armchair, and a rickety table stood 
grouped together in a pool of dim light cast by a 
candle-filled lamp hung from the ceiling. The place 
had an air of neglect, as though it was not usually 
inhabited. 

Snape gestured Narcissa to the sofa. She threw off 
her cloak, cast it aside, and sat down, staring at her 
white and trembling hands clasped in her lap. 

Bellatrix lowered her hood more slowly. Dark as her 
sister was fair, with heavily lidded eyes and a strong 
jaw, she did not take her gaze from Snape as she 
moved to stand behind Narcissa. 

“So, what can I do for you?” Snape asked, settling 
himself in the armchair opposite the two sisters. 

“We ... we are alone, aren’t we?” Narcissa asked 
quietly. 

“Yes, of course. Well, Wormtail’s here, but we’re not 
counting vermin, are we?” 

He pointed his wand at the wall of books behind him 
and with a bang, a hidden door flew open, revealing a 

Page | 26 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




narrow staircase upon which a small man stood 
frozen. 

“As you have clearly realized, Wormtail, we have 
guests,” said Snape lazily. 

The man crept, hunchbacked, down the last few steps 
and moved into the room. He had small, watery eyes, 
a pointed nose, and wore an unpleasant simper. His 
left hand was caressing his right, which looked as 
though it was encased in a bright silver glove. 

“Narcissa!” he said, in a squeaky voice. “And Bellatrix! 
How charming — ” 

“Wormtail will get us drinks, if you’d like them,” said 
Snape. “And then he will return to his bedroom.” 

Wormtail winced as though Snape had thrown 
something at him. 

“I am not your servant!” he squeaked, avoiding 
Snape ’s eye. 

“Really? I was under the impression that the Dark 
Lord placed you here to assist me.” 

“To assist, yes — but not to make you drinks and — 
and clean your house!” 

“I had no idea, Wormtail, that you were craving more 
dangerous assignments,” said Snape silkily. “This can 
be easily arranged: I shall speak to the Dark Lord — ” 

“I can speak to him myself if I want to!” 

“Of course you can,” said Snape, sneering. “But in the 
meantime, bring us drinks. Some of the elf-made wine 
will do.” 

Page | 27 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Wormtail hesitated for a moment, looking as though 
he might argue, but then turned and headed through 
a second hidden door. They heard banging and a 
clinking of glasses. Within seconds he was back, 
bearing a dusty bottle and three glasses upon a tray. 
He dropped these on the rickety table and scurried 
from their presence, slamming the book-covered door 
behind him. 

Snape poured out three glasses of bloodred wine and 
handed two of them to the sisters. Narcissa 
murmured a word of thanks, whilst Bellatrix said 
nothing, but continued to glower at Snape. This did 
not seem to discompose him; on the contrary, he 
looked rather amused. 

“The Dark Lord,” he said, raising his glass and 
draining it. 

The sisters copied him. Snape refilled their glasses. 

As Narcissa took her second drink she said in a rush, 
“Severus, I’m sorry to come here like this, but I had to 
see you. I think you are the only one who can help me 



Snape held up a hand to stop her, then pointed his 
wand again at the concealed staircase door. There 
was a loud bang and a squeal, followed by the sound 
of Wormtail scurrying back up the stairs. 

“My apologies,” said Snape. “He has lately taken to 
listening at doors, I don’t know what he means by it. 

... You were saying, Narcissa?” 

She took a great, shuddering breath and started 
again. 

“Severus, I know I ought not to be here, I have been 
told to say nothing to anyone, but — ” 

Page | 28 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Then you ought to hold your tongue!” snarled 
Bellatrix. “Particularly in present company!” 

“ ‘Present company’?” repeated Snape sardonically. 
“And what am I to understand by that, Bellatrix?” 

“That I don’t trust you, Snape, as you very well 
know!” 

Narcissa let out a noise that might have been a dry 
sob and covered her face with her hands. Snape set 
his glass down upon the table and sat back again, his 
hands upon the arms of his chair, smiling into 
Bellatrix’s glowering face. 

“Narcissa, I think we ought to hear what Bellatrix is 
bursting to say; it will save tedious interruptions. 

Well, continue, Bellatrix,” said Snape. “Why is it that 
you do not trust me?” 

“A hundred reasons!” she said loudly, striding out 
from behind the sofa to slam her glass upon the table. 
“Where to start! Where were you when the Dark Lord 
fell? Why did you never make any attempt to find him 
when he vanished? What have you been doing all 
these years that you’ve lived in Dumbledore’s pocket? 
Why did you stop the Dark Lord procuring the 
Sorcerer’s Stone? Why did you not return at once 
when the Dark Lord was reborn? Where were you a 
few weeks ago when we battled to retrieve the 
prophecy for the Dark Lord? And why, Snape, is 
Harry Potter still alive, when you have had him at 
your mercy for five years?” 

She paused, her chest rising and falling rapidly, the 
color high in her cheeks. Behind her, Narcissa sat 
motionless, her face still hidden in her hands. 

Snape smiled. 

Page | 29 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Before I answer you — oh yes, Bellatrix, I am going 
to answer! You can carry my words back to the others 
who whisper behind my back, and carry false tales of 
my treachery to the Dark Lord! Before I answer you, I 
say, let me ask a question in turn. Do you really think 
that the Dark Lord has not asked me each and every 
one of those questions? And do you really think that, 
had I not been able to give satisfactory answers, I 
would be sitting here talking to you?” 

She hesitated. 

“I know he believes you, but ...” 

“You think he is mistaken? Or that I have somehow 
hoodwinked him? Fooled the Dark Lord, the greatest 
wizard, the most accomplished Legilimens the world 
has ever seen?” 

Bellatrix said nothing, but looked, for the first time, a 
little discomfited. Snape did not press the point. He 
picked up his drink again, sipped it, and continued, 
“You ask where I was when the Dark Lord fell. I was 
where he had ordered me to be, at Hogwarts School of 
Witchcraft and Wizardry, because he wished me to 
spy upon Albus Dumbledore. You know, I presume, 
that it was on the Dark Lord’s orders that I took up 
the post?” 

She nodded almost imperceptibly and then opened 
her mouth, but Snape forestalled her. 

“You ask why I did not attempt to find him when he 
vanished. For the same reason that Avery, Yaxley, the 
Carrows, Greyback, Lucius” — he inclined his head 
slightly to Narcissa — “and many others did not 
attempt to find him. I believed him finished. I am not 
proud of it, I was wrong, but there it is. ... If he had 



Page | 30 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




not forgiven we who lost faith at that time, he would 
have very few followers left.” 

“He’d have me!” said Bellatrix passionately. “I, who 
spent many years in Azkaban for him!” 

“Yes, indeed, most admirable,” said Snape in a bored 
voice. “Of course, you weren’t a lot of use to him in 
prison, but the gesture was undoubtedly fine — ” 

“Gesture!” she shrieked; in her fury she looked 
slightly mad. “While I endured the dementors, you 
remained at Hogwarts, comfortably playing 
Dumbledore’s pet!” 

“Not quite,” said Snape calmly. “He wouldn’t give me 
the Defense Against the Dark Arts job, you know. 
Seemed to think it might, ah, bring about a relapse . . . 
tempt me into my old ways.” 

“This was your sacrifice for the Dark Lord, not to 
teach your favorite subject?” she jeered. “Why did you 
stay there all that time, Snape? Still spying on 
Dumbledore for a master you believed dead?” 

“Hardly,” said Snape, “although the Dark Lord is 
pleased that I never deserted my post: I had sixteen 
years of information on Dumbledore to give him when 
he returned, a rather more useful welcome-back 
present than endless reminiscences of how 
unpleasant Azkaban is. ...” 

“But you stayed — ” 

“Yes, Bellatrix, I stayed,” said Snape, betraying a hint 
of impatience for the first time. “I had a comfortable 
job that I preferred to a stint in Azkaban. They were 
rounding up the Death Eaters, you know. 
Dumbledore’s protection kept me out of jail; it was 
Page | 31 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling 




most convenient and I used it. I repeat: The Dark 
Lord does not complain that I stayed, so I do not see 
why you do. 

“I think you next wanted to know,” he pressed on, a 
little more loudly, for Bellatrix showed every sign of 
interrupting, “why I stood between the Dark Lord and 
the Sorcerer’s Stone. That is easily answered. He did 
not know whether he could trust me. He thought, like 
you, that I had turned from faithful Death Eater to 
Dumbledore’s stooge. He was in a pitiable condition, 
very weak, sharing the body of a mediocre wizard. He 
did not dare reveal himself to a former ally if that ally 
might turn him over to Dumbledore or the Ministry. I 
deeply regret that he did not trust me. He would have 
returned to power three years sooner. As it was, I saw 
only greedy and unworthy Quirrell attempting to steal 
the stone and, I admit, I did all I could to thwart him.” 

Bellatrix’s mouth twisted as though she had taken an 
unpleasant dose of medicine. 

“But you didn’t return when he came back, you didn’t 
fly back to him at once when you felt the Dark Mark 
burn — ” 

“Correct. I returned two hours later. I returned on 
Dumbledore’s orders.” 

“On Dumbledore’s — ?” she began, in tones of 
outrage. 

“Think!” said Snape, impatient again. “Think! By 
waiting two hours, just two hours, I ensured that I 
could remain at Hogwarts as a spy! By allowing 
Dumbledore to think that I was only returning to the 
Dark Lord’s side because I was ordered to, I have 
been able to pass information on Dumbledore and the 
Order of the Phoenix ever since! Consider, Bellatrix: 
Page | 32 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




The Dark Mark had been growing stronger for 
months. I knew he must be about to return, all the 
Death Eaters knew! I had plenty of time to think 
about what I wanted to do, to plan my next move, to 
escape like Karkaroff, didn’t I? 

“The Dark Lord’s initial displeasure at my lateness 
vanished entirely, I assure you, when I explained that 
I remained faithful, although Dumbledore thought I 
was his man. Yes, the Dark Lord thought that I had 
left him forever, but he was wrong.” 

“But what use have you been?” sneered Bellatrix. 
“What useful information have we had from you?” 

“My information has been conveyed directly to the 
Dark Lord,” said Snape. “If he chooses not to share it 
with you — ” 

“He shares everything with me!” said Bellatrix, firing 
up at once. “He calls me his most loyal, his most 
faithful — ” 

“Does he?” said Snape, his voice delicately inflected to 
suggest his disbelief. “Does he still, after the fiasco at 
the Ministry?” 

“That was not my fault!” said Bellatrix, flushing. “The 
Dark Lord has, in the past, entrusted me with his 
most precious — if Lucius hadn’t — ” 

“Don’t you dare — don’t you dare blame my 
husband!” said Narcissa, in a low and deadly voice, 
looking up at her sister. 

“There is no point apportioning blame,” said Snape 
smoothly. “What is done, is done.” 



Page | 33 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“But not by you!” said Bellatrix furiously. “No, you 
were once again absent while the rest of us ran 
dangers, were you not, Snape?” 

“My orders were to remain behind,” said Snape. 
“Perhaps you disagree with the Dark Lord, perhaps 
you think that Dumbledore would not have noticed if 
I had joined forces with the Death Eaters to fight the 
Order of the Phoenix? And — forgive me — you speak 
of dangers ... you were facing six teenagers, were you 
not?” 

“They were joined, as you very well know, by half of 
the Order before long!” snarled Bellatrix. “And, while 
we are on the subject of the Order, you still claim you 
cannot reveal the whereabouts of their headquarters, 
don’t you?” 

“I am not the Secret-Keeper; I cannot speak the name 
of the place. You understand how the enchantment 
works, I think? The Dark Lord is satisfied with the 
information I have passed him on the Order. It led, as 
perhaps you have guessed, to the recent capture and 
murder of Emmeline Vance, and it certainly helped 
dispose of Sirius Black, though I give you full credit 
for finishing him off.” 

He inclined his head and toasted her. Her expression 
did not soften. 

“You are avoiding my last question, Snape. Harry 
Potter. You could have killed him at any point in the 
past five years. You have not done it. Why?” 

“Have you discussed this matter with the Dark Lord?” 
asked Snape. 

“He ... lately, we ... I am asking you, Snape!” 



Page | 34 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“If I had murdered Harry Potter, the Dark Lord could 
not have used his blood to regenerate, making him 
invincible — ” 

“You claim you foresaw his use of the boy!” she 
jeered. 

“I do not claim it; I had no idea of his plans; I have 
already confessed that I thought the Dark Lord dead. 

I am merely trying to explain why the Dark Lord is 
not sorry that Potter survived, at least until a year 
ago. ...” 

“But why did you keep him alive?” 

“Have you not understood me? It was only 
Dumbledore’s protection that was keeping me out of 
Azkaban! Do you disagree that murdering his favorite 
student might have turned him against me? But there 
was more to it than that. I should remind you that 
when Potter first arrived at Hogwarts there were still 
many stories circulating about him, rumors that he 
himself was a great Dark wizard, which was how he 
had survived the Dark Lord’s attack. Indeed, many of 
the Dark Lord’s old followers thought Potter might be 
a standard around which we could all rally once 
more. I was curious, I admit it, and not at all inclined 
to murder him the moment he set foot in the castle. 

“Of course, it became apparent to me very quickly 
that he had no extraordinary talent at all. He has 
fought his way out of a number of tight corners by a 
simple combination of sheer luck and more talented 
friends. He is mediocre to the last degree, though as 
obnoxious and self-satisfied as was his father before 
him. I have done my utmost to have him thrown out 
of Hogwarts, where I believe he scarcely belongs, but 
kill him, or allow him to be killed in front of me? I 



Page | 35 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




would have been a fool to risk it with Dumbledore 
close at hand.” 

“And through all this we are supposed to believe 
Dumbledore has never suspected you?” asked 
Bellatrix. “He has no idea of your true allegiance, he 
trusts you implicitly still?” 

“I have played my part well,” said Snape. “And you 
overlook Dumbledore’s greatest weakness: He has to 
believe the best of people. I spun him a tale of deepest 
remorse when I joined his staff, fresh from my Death 
Eater days, and he embraced me with open arms — 
though, as I say, never allowing me nearer the Dark 
Arts than he could help. Dumbledore has been a 
great wizard — oh yes, he has,” (for Bellatrix had 
made a scathing noise), “the Dark Lord acknowledges 
it. I am pleased to say, however, that Dumbledore is 
growing old. The duel with the Dark Lord last month 
shook him. He has since sustained a serious injury 
because his reactions are slower than they once were. 
But through all these years, he has never stopped 
trusting Severus Snape, and therein lies my great 
value to the Dark Lord.” 

Bellatrix still looked unhappy, though she appeared 
unsure how best to attack Snape next. Taking 
advantage of her silence, Snape turned to her sister. 

“Now ... you came to ask me for help, Narcissa?” 

Narcissa looked up at him, her face eloquent with 
despair. 

“Yes, Severus. I — I think you are the only one who 
can help me, I have nowhere else to turn. Lucius is in 
jail and ...” 



Page | 36 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




She closed her eyes and two large tears seeped from 
beneath her eyelids. 

“The Dark Lord has forbidden me to speak of it,” 
Narcissa continued, her eyes still closed. “He wishes 
none to know of the plan. It is ... very secret. But — ” 

“If he has forbidden it, you ought not to speak,” said 
Snape at once. “The Dark Lord’s word is law.” 

Narcissa gasped as though he had doused her with 
cold water. Bellatrix looked satisfied for the first time 
since she had entered the house. 

“There!” she said triumphantly to her sister. “Even 
Snape says so: You were told not to talk, so hold your 
silence!” 

But Snape had gotten to his feet and strode to the 
small window, peered through the curtains at the 
deserted street, then closed them again with a jerk. 

He turned around to face Narcissa, frowning. 

“It so happens that I know of the plan,” he said in a 
low voice. “I am one of the few the Dark Lord has told. 
Nevertheless, had I not been in on the secret, 

Narcissa, you would have been guilty of great 
treachery to the Dark Lord.” 

“I thought you must know about it!” said Narcissa, 
breathing more freely. “He trusts you so, Severus. ...” 

“You know about the plan?” said Bellatrix, her fleeting 
expression of satisfaction replaced by a look of 
outrage. “ You know?” 

“Certainly,” said Snape. “But what help do you 
require, Narcissa? If you are imagining I can persuade 



Page | 37 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




the Dark Lord to change his mind, I am afraid there is 
no hope, none at all.” 

“Severus,” she whispered, tears sliding down her pale 
cheeks. “My son ... my only son ...” 

“Draco should be proud,” said Bellatrix indifferently. 
“The Dark Lord is granting him a great honor. And I 
will say this for Draco: He isn’t shrinking away from 
his duty, he seems glad of a chance to prove himself, 
excited at the prospect — ” 

Narcissa began to cry in earnest, gazing beseechingly 
all the while at Snape. 

“That’s because he is sixteen and has no idea what 
lies in store! Why, Severus? Why my son? It is too 
dangerous! This is vengeance for Lucius’s mistake, I 
know it!” 

Snape said nothing. He looked away from the sight of 
her tears as though they were indecent, but he could 
not pretend not to hear her. 

“That’s why he’s chosen Draco, isn’t it?” she 
persisted. “To punish Lucius?” 

“If Draco succeeds,” said Snape, still looking away 
from her, “he will be honored above all others.” 

“But he won’t succeed!” sobbed Narcissa. “How can 
he, when the Dark Lord himself — ?” 

Bellatrix gasped; Narcissa seemed to lose her nerve. 

“I only meant ... that nobody has yet succeeded. ... 
Severus ... please ... You are, you have always been, 
Draco’s favorite teacher. ... You are Lucius’s old 
friend. ... I beg you. ... You are the Dark Lord’s 

Page | 38 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




favorite, his most trusted advisor. ... Will you speak to 
him, persuade him — ?” 

“The Dark Lord will not be persuaded, and I am not 
stupid enough to attempt it,” said Snape flatly. “I 
cannot pretend that the Dark Lord is not angry with 
Lucius. Lucius was supposed to be in charge. He got 
himself captured, along with how many others, and 
failed to retrieve the prophecy into the bargain. Yes, 
the Dark Lord is angry, Narcissa, very angry indeed.” 

“Then I am right, he has chosen Draco in revenge!” 
choked Narcissa. “He does not mean him to succeed, 
he wants him to be killed trying!” 

When Snape said nothing, Narcissa seemed to lose 
what little self-restraint she still possessed. Standing 
up, she staggered to Snape and seized the front of his 
robes. Her face close to his, her tears falling onto his 
chest, she gasped, “You could do it. You could do it 
instead of Draco, Severus. You would succeed, of 
course you would, and he would reward you beyond 
all of us — ” 

Snape caught hold of her wrists and removed her 
clutching hands. Looking down into her tears tained 
face, he said slowly, “He intends me to do it in the 
end, I think. But he is determined that Draco should 
try first. You see, in the unlikely event that Draco 
succeeds, I shall be able to remain at Hogwarts a little 
longer, fulfilling my useful role as spy.” 

“In other words, it doesn’t matter to him if Draco is 
killed!” 

“The Dark Lord is very angry,” repeated Snape 
quietly. “He failed to hear the prophecy. You know as 
well as I do, Narcissa, that he does not forgive easily.”

She crumpled, falling at his feet, sobbing and 
moaning on the floor. 



“My only son ... my only son ...” 

“You should be proud!” said Bellatrix ruthlessly. “If I 
had sons, I would be glad to give them up to the 
service of the Dark Lord!” 

Narcissa gave a little scream of despair and clutched 
at her long blonde hair. Snape stooped, seized her by 
the arms, lifted her up, and steered her back onto the 
sofa. He then poured her more wine and forced the 
glass into her hand. 

“Narcissa, that’s enough. Drink this. Listen to me.” 

She quieted a little; slopping wine down herself, she 
took a shaky sip. 

“It might be possible ... for me to help Draco.” 

She sat up, her face paper-white, her eyes huge. 

“Severus — oh, Severus — you would help him? 

Would you look after him, see he comes to no harm?” 

“I can try.” 

She flung away her glass; it skidded across the table 
as she slid off the sofa into a kneeling position at 
Snape ’s feet, seized his hand in both of hers, and 
pressed her lips to it. 

“If you are there to protect him ... Severus, will you 
swear it? Will you make the Unbreakable Vow?” 

“The Unbreakable Vow?” 

Page | 40 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling 




Snape’s expression was blank, unreadable. Bellatrix, 
however, let out a cackle of triumphant laughter. 

“Aren’t you listening, Narcissa? Oh, he’ll try, I’m sure. 
... The usual empty words, the usual slithering out of 
action ... oh, on the Dark Lord’s orders, of course!” 

Snape did not look at Bellatrix. His black eyes were 
fixed upon Narcissa’s tear-filled blue ones as she 
continued to clutch his hand. 

“Certainly, Narcissa, I shall make the Unbreakable 
Vow,” he said quietly. “Perhaps your sister will 
consent to be our Bonder.” 

Bellatrix’s mouth fell open. Snape lowered himself so 
that he was kneeling opposite Narcissa. Beneath 
Bellatrix’s astonished gaze, they grasped right hands. 

“You will need your wand, Bellatrix,” said Snape 
coldly. 

She drew it, still looking astonished. 

“And you will need to move a little closer,” he said. 

She stepped forward so that she stood over them, and 
placed the tip of her wand on their linked hands. 

Narcissa spoke. 

“Will you, Severus, watch over my son, Draco, as he 
attempts to fulfill the Dark Lord’s wishes?” 

“I will,” said Snape. 

A thin tongue of brilliant flame issued from the wand 
and wound its way around their hands like a red-hot 
wire. 

Page | 41 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling 




“And will you, to the best of your ability, protect him 
from harm?” 

“I will,” said Snape. 

A second tongue of flame shot from the wand and 
interlinked with the first, making a fine, glowing 
chain. 

“And, should it prove necessary ... if it seems Draco 
will fail ...” whispered Narcissa (Snape’s hand 
twitched within hers, but he did not draw away), “will 
you carry out the deed that the Dark Lord has 
ordered Draco to perform?” 

There was a moment’s silence. Bellatrix watched, her 
wand upon their clasped hands, her eyes wide. 

“I will,” said Snape. 

Bellatrix’s astounded face glowed red in the blaze of a 
third tongue of flame, which shot from the wand, 
twisted with the others, and bound itself thickly 
around their clasped hands, like a rope, like a fiery 
snake.

WILL AND WON’T 

Harry Potter was snoring loudly. He had been sitting 
in a chair beside his bedroom window for the best 
part of four hours, staring out at the darkening street, 
and had finally fallen asleep with one side of his face 
pressed against the cold windowpane, his glasses 
askew and his mouth wide open. The misty fug his 
breath had left on the window sparkled in the orange 
glare of the streetlamp outside, and the artificial light 
drained his face of all color, so that he looked ghostly 
beneath his shock of untidy black hair. 

The room was strewn with various possessions and a 
good smattering of rubbish. Owl feathers, apple cores, 
and sweet wrappers littered the floor, a number of 
spellbooks lay higgledy-piggledy among the tangled 
robes on his bed, and a mess of newspapers sat in a 
puddle of light on his desk. The headline of one 
blared: 

HARRY POTTER: THE CHOSEN ONE? 



Page | 43 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 



Rumors continue to fly about the mysterious recent 
disturbance at the Ministry of Magic, during which 
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named was sighted once more. 

“We’re not allowed to talk about it, don’t ask me 
anything,” said one agitated Obliviator, who refused 
to give his name as he left the Ministry last night. 

Nevertheless, highly placed sources within the 
Ministry have confirmed that the disturbance 
centered on the fabled Hall of Prophecy. 

Though Ministry spokeswizards have hitherto refused 
even to confirm the existence of such a place, a 
growing number of the Wizarding community believe 
that the Death Eaters now serving sentences in 
Azkaban for trespass and attempted theft were 
attempting to steal a prophecy. The nature of that 
prophecy is unknown, although speculation is rife 
that it concerns Harry Potter, the only person ever 
known to have survived the Killing Curse, and who is 
also known to have been at the Ministry on the night 
in question. Some are going so far as to call Potter 
“the Chosen One,” believing that the prophecy names 
him as the only one who will be able to rid us of He- 
Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. 

The current whereabouts of the prophecy, if it exists, 
are unknown, although (ctd. page 2, column 5) 

A second newspaper lay beside the first. This one bore 
the headline: 

SCRIMGEOUR SUCCEEDS FUDGE 

Most of this front page was taken up with a large 
black-and-white picture of a man with a lionlike mane 
of thick hair and a rather ravaged face. The picture 
was moving — the man was waving at the ceiling. 

Page | 44 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Rufus Scrimgeour, previously Head of the Auror office 
in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, has 
succeeded Cornelius Fudge as Minister of Magic. The 
appointment has largely been greeted with 
enthusiasm by the Wizarding community, though 
rumors of a rift between the new Minister and Albus 
Dumbledore, newly reinstated Chief Warlock of the 
Wizengamot, surfaced within hours of Scrimgeour 
taking office. 

Scrimgeour’s representatives admitted that he had met 
with Dumbledore at once upon taking possession of the 
top job, but refused to comment on the topics under 
discussion. Albus Dumbledore is known to (ctd. page 
3, column 2) 

To the left of this paper sat another, which had been 
folded so that a story bearing the title MINISTRY 
GUARANTEES STUDENTS’ SAFETY was visible. 

Newly appointed Minister of Magic, Rufus 
Scrimgeour, spoke today of the tough new measures 
taken by his Ministry to ensure the safety of students 
returning to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and 
Wizardry this autumn. 

“For obvious reasons, the Ministry will not be going 
into detail about its stringent new security plans,” 
said the Minister, although an insider confirmed that 
measures include defensive spells and charms, a 
complex array of countercurses, and a small task 
force of Aurors dedicated solely to the protection of 
Hogwarts School. 

Most seem reassured by the new Minister’s tough 
stand on student safety. Said Mrs. Augusta 
Longbottom, “My grandson, Neville — a good friend of 
Harry Potter’s, incidentally, who fought the Death 
Eaters alongside him at the Ministry in June and —

But the rest of this story was obscured by the large 
birdcage standing on top of it. Inside it was a 
magnificent snowy owl. Her amber eyes surveyed the 
room imperiously, her head swiveling occasionally to 
gaze at her snoring master. Once or twice she clicked 
her beak impatiently, but Harry was too deeply asleep 
to hear her. 

A large trunk stood in the very middle of the room. Its 
lid was open; it looked expectant; yet it was almost 
empty but for a residue of old underwear, sweets, 
empty ink bottles, and broken quills that coated the 
very bottom. Nearby, on the floor, lay a purple leaflet 
emblazoned with the words: 

— ISSUED ON BEHALF OF — 

THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC 

PROTECTING YOUR HOME AND FAMILY 

AGAINST DARK FORCES 

The Wizarding community is currently under threat 
from an organization calling itself the Death Eaters. 
Observing the following simple security guidelines will 
help protect you, your family, and your home from 
attack. 

1. You are advised not to leave the house alone. 

2. Particular care should be taken during the 
hours of darkness. Wherever possible, arrange to 
complete journeys before night has fallen. 

3. Review the security arrangements around your 
house, making sure that all family members are 
aware of emergency measures such as Shield and 



Page | 46 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Disillusionment Charms, and, in the case of underage 
family members, Side-Along-Apparition. 

4. Agree on security questions with close friends 
and family so as to detect Death Eaters masquerading 
as others by use of the Polyjuice Potion (see page 2). 

5. Should you feel that a family member, 
colleague, friend, or neighbor is acting in a strange 
manner, contact the Magical Law Enforcement Squad 
at once. They may have been put under the Imperius 
Curse (see page 4). 

6. Should the Dark Mark appear over any dwelling 
place or other building, DO NOT ENTER, but contact 
the Auror office immediately. 

7. Unconfirmed sightings suggest that the Death 
Eaters may now be using Inferi (see page 10). Any 
sighting of an Inferius, or encounter with same, 
should be reported to the Ministry IMMEDIATELY. 

Harry grunted in his sleep and his face slid down the 
window an inch or so, making his glasses still more 
lopsided, but he did not wake up. An alarm clock, 
repaired by Harry several years ago, ticked loudly on 
the sill, showing one minute to eleven. Beside it, held 
in place by Harry’s relaxed hand, was a piece of 
parchment covered in thin, slanting writing. Harry 
had read this letter so often since its arrival three 
days ago that although it had been delivered in a 
tightly furled scroll, it now lay quite flat. 

Dear Harry, 

If it is convenient to you, I shall call at number four, 
Privet Drive this coming Friday at eleven p.m. to escort 
you to the Burrow, where you have been invited to 
spend the remainder of your school holidays. 

Page | 47 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




If you are agreeable, I should also be glad of your 
assistance in a matter to which I hope to attend on the 
way to the Burrow. I shall explain this more fully when 
I see you. 

Kindly send your answer by return of this owl. Hoping 
to see you this Friday, 

I am, yours most sincerely, 

Albus Dumbledore 

Though he already knew it by heart, Harry had been 
stealing glances at this missive every few minutes 
since seven o’clock that evening, when he had first 
taken up his position beside his bedroom window, 
which had a reasonable view of both ends of Privet 
Drive. He knew it was pointless to keep rereading 
Dumbledore ’s words; Harry had sent back his “yes” 
with the delivering owl, as requested, and all he could 
do now was wait: Either Dumbledore was going to 
come, or he was not. 

But Harry had not packed. It just seemed too good to 
be true that he was going to be rescued from the 
Dursleys after a mere fortnight of their company. He 
could not shrug off the feeling that something was 
going to go wrong — his reply to Dumbledore ’s letter 
might have gone astray; Dumbledore could be 
prevented from collecting him; the letter might turn 
out not to be from Dumbledore at all, but a trick or 
joke or trap. Harry had not been able to face packing 
and then being let down and having to unpack again. 
The only gesture he had made to the possibility of a 
journey was to shut his snowy owl, Hedwig, safely in 
her cage. 



Page | 48 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




The minute hand on the alarm clock reached the 
number twelve and, at that precise moment, the 
streetlamp outside the window went out. 

Harry awoke as though the sudden darkness were an 
alarm. Hastily straightening his glasses and 
unsticking his cheek from the glass, he pressed his 
nose against the window instead and squinted down 
at the pavement. A tall figure in a long, billowing 
cloak was walking up the garden path. 

Harry jumped up as though he had received an 
electric shock, knocked over his chair, and started 
snatching anything and everything within reach from 
the floor and throwing it into the trunk. Even as he 
lobbed a set of robes, two spellbooks, and a packet of 
crisps across the room, the doorbell rang. Downstairs 
in the living room his Uncle Vernon shouted, “Who 
the blazes is calling at this time of night?” 

Harry froze with a brass telescope in one hand and a 
pair of trainers in the other. He had completely 
forgotten to warn the Dursleys that Dumbledore 
might be coming. Feeling both panicky and close to 
laughter, he clambered over the trunk and wrenched 
open his bedroom door in time to hear a deep voice 
say, “Good evening. You must be Mr. Dursley. I 
daresay Harry has told you I would be coming for 
him?” 

Harry ran down the stairs two at a time, coming to an 
abrupt halt several steps from the bottom, as long 
experience had taught him to remain out of arm’s 
reach of his uncle whenever possible. There in the 
doorway stood a tall, thin man with waist-length 
silver hair and beard. Half-moon spectacles were 
perched on his crooked nose, and he was wearing a 
long black traveling cloak and a pointed hat. Vernon 
Dursley, whose mustache was quite as bushy as 
Page | 49 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Dumbledore ’s, though black, and who was wearing a 
puce dressing gown, was staring at the visitor as 
though he could not believe his tiny eyes. 

“Judging by your look of stunned disbelief, Harry did 
not warn you that I was coming,” said Dumbledore 
pleasantly. “However, let us assume that you have 
invited me warmly into your house. It is unwise to 
linger overlong on doorsteps in these troubled times.” 

He stepped smartly over the threshold and closed the 
front door behind him. 

“It is a long time since my last visit,” said 
Dumbledore, peering down his crooked nose at Uncle 
Vernon. “I must say, your agapanthus are 
flourishing.” 

Vernon Dursley said nothing at all. Harry did not 
doubt that speech would return to him, and soon — 
the vein pulsing in his uncle’s temple was reaching 
danger point — but something about Dumbledore 
seemed to have robbed him temporarily of breath. It 
might have been the blatant wizardishness of his 
appearance, but it might, too, have been that even 
Uncle Vernon could sense that here was a man whom 
it would be very difficult to bully. 

“Ah, good evening Harry,” said Dumbledore, looking 
up at him through his half-moon glasses with a most 
satisfied expression. “Excellent, excellent.” 

These words seemed to rouse Uncle Vernon. It was 
clear that as far as he was concerned, any man who 
could look at Harry and say “excellent” was a man 
with whom he could never see eye to eye. 

“I don’t mean to be rude — ” he began, in a tone that 
threatened rudeness in every syllable. 

Page | 50 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling 




“ — yet, sadly, accidental rudeness occurs alarmingly 
often,” Dumbledore finished the sentence gravely. 
“Best to say nothing at all, my dear man. Ah, and this 
must be Petunia.” 

The kitchen door had opened, and there stood Harry’s 
aunt, wearing rubber gloves and a housecoat over her 
nightdress, clearly halfway through her usual pre- 
bedtime wipe-down of all the kitchen surfaces. Her 
rather horsey face registered nothing but shock. 

“Albus Dumbledore,” said Dumbledore, when Uncle 
Vernon failed to effect an introduction. “We have 
corresponded, of course.” Harry thought this an odd 
way of reminding Aunt Petunia that he had once sent 
her an exploding letter, but Aunt Petunia did not 
challenge the term. “And this must be your son, 
Dudley?” 

Dudley had that moment peered round the living 
room door. His large, blond head rising out of the 
stripy collar of his pajamas looked oddly disembodied, 
his mouth gaping in astonishment and fear. 
Dumbledore waited a moment or two, apparently to 
see whether any of the Dursleys were going to say 
anything, but as the silence stretched on he smiled. 

“Shall we assume that you have invited me into your 
sitting room? 

Dudley scrambled out of the way as Dumbledore 
passed him. Harry, still clutching the telescope and 
trainers, jumped the last few stairs and followed 
Dumbledore, who had settled himself in the armchair 
nearest the fire and was taking in the surroundings 
with an expression of benign interest. He looked quite 
extraordinarily out of place. 



Page | 51 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Aren’t — aren’t we leaving, sir?” Harry asked 
anxiously. 

“Yes, indeed we are, but there are a few matters we 
need to discuss first,” said Dumbledore. “And I would 
prefer not to do so in the open. We shall trespass 
upon your aunt and uncle’s hospitality only a little 
longer.” 

“You will, will you?” 

Vernon Dursley had entered the room, Petunia at his 
shoulder, and Dudley skulking behind them both. 

“Yes,” said Dumbledore simply, “I shall.” 

He drew his wand so rapidly that Harry barely saw it; 
with a casual flick, the sofa zoomed forward and 
knocked the knees out from under all three of the 
Dursley s so that they collapsed upon it in a heap. 
Another flick of the wand and the sofa zoomed back 
to its original position. 

“We may as well be comfortable,” said Dumbledore 
pleasantly. 

As he replaced his wand in his pocket, Harry saw that 
his hand was blackened and shriveled; it looked as 
though his flesh had been burned away. 

“Sir — what happened to your — ?” 

“Later, Harry,” said Dumbledore. “Please sit down.” 

Harry took the remaining armchair, choosing not to 
look at the Dursleys, who seemed stunned into 
silence. 



Page | 52 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“I would assume that you were going to offer me 
refreshment,” Dumbledore said to Uncle Vernon, “but 
the evidence so far suggests that that would be 
optimistic to the point of foolishness.” 

A third twitch of the wand, and a dusty bottle and five 
glasses appeared in midair. The bottle tipped and 
poured a generous measure of honey-colored liquid 
into each of the glasses, which then floated to each 
person in the room. 

“Madam Rosmerta’s finest oak-matured mead,” said 
Dumbledore, raising his glass to Harry, who caught 
hold of his own and sipped. He had never tasted 
anything like it before, but enjoyed it immensely. The 
Dursleys, after quick, scared looks at one another, 
tried to ignore their glasses completely, a difficult feat, 
as they were nudging them gently on the sides of their 
heads. Harry could not suppress a suspicion that 
Dumbledore was rather enjoying himself. 

“Well, Harry,” said Dumbledore, turning toward him, 
“a difficulty has arisen which I hope you will be able 
to solve for us. By us, I mean the Order of the 
Phoenix. But first of all I must tell you that Sirius’s 
will was discovered a week ago and that he left you 
everything he owned.” 

Over on the sofa, Uncle Vernon’s head turned, but 
Harry did not look at him, nor could he think of 
anything to say except, “Oh. Right.” 

“This is, in the main, fairly straightforward,” 
Dumbledore went on. “You add a reasonable amount 
of gold to your account at Gringotts, and you inherit 
all of Sirius’s personal possessions. The slightly 
problematic part of the legacy — ” 



Page | 53 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“His godfather’s dead?” said Uncle Vernon loudly from 
the sofa. Dumbledore and Harry both turned to look 
at him. The glass of mead was now knocking quite 
insistently on the side of Vernon’s head; he attempted 
to beat it away. “He’s dead? His godfather?” 

“Yes,” said Dumbledore. He did not ask Harry why he 
had not confided in the Dursleys. “Our problem,” he 
continued to Harry, as if there had been no 
interruption, “is that Sirius also left you number 
twelve, Grimmauld Place.” 

“He’s been left a house?” said Uncle Vernon greedily, 
his small eyes narrowing, but nobody answered him. 

“You can keep using it as headquarters,” said Harry. 

“I don’t care. You can have it, I don’t really want it.” 
Harry never wanted to set foot in number twelve, 
Grimmauld Place again if he could help it. He thought 
he would be haunted forever by the memory of Sirius 
prowling its dark musty rooms alone, imprisoned 
within the place he had wanted so desperately to 
leave. 

“That is generous,” said Dumbledore. “We have, 
however, vacated the building temporarily.” 

“Why?” 

“Well,” said Dumbledore, ignoring the mutterings of 
Uncle Vernon, who was now being rapped smartly 
over the head by the persistent glass of mead, “Black 
family tradition decreed that the house was handed 
down the direct line, to the next male with the name 
of ‘Black. ’ Sirius was the very last of the line as his 
younger brother, Regulus, predeceased him and both 
were childless. While his will makes it perfectly plain 
that he wants you to have the house, it is 
nevertheless possible that some spell or enchantment 
Page | 54 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




has been set upon the place to ensure that it cannot 
be owned by anyone other than a pureblood.” 



A vivid image of the shrieking, spitting portrait of 
Sirius’s mother that hung in the hall of number 
twelve, Grimmauld Place flashed into Harry’s mind. “I 
bet there has,” he said. 

“Quite,” said Dumbledore. “And if such an 
enchantment exists, then the ownership of the house 
is most likely to pass to the eldest of Sirius’s living 
relatives, which would mean his cousin, Bellatrix 
Lestrange.” 

Without realizing what he was doing, Harry sprang to 
his feet; the telescope and trainers in his lap rolled 
across the floor. Bellatrix Lestrange, Sirius’s killer, 
inherit his house? 

“No,” he said. 

“Well, obviously we would prefer that she didn’t get it 
either,” said Dumbledore calmly. “The situation is 
fraught with complications. We do not know whether 
the enchantments we ourselves have placed upon it, 
for example, making it Unplottable, will hold now that 
ownership has passed from Sirius’s hands. It might 
be that Bellatrix will arrive on the doorstep at any 
moment. Naturally we had to move out until such 
time as we have clarified the position.” 

“But how are you going to find out if I’m allowed to 
own it?” 

“Fortunately,” said Dumbledore, “there is a simple 
test.” 

He placed his empty glass on a small table beside his 
chair, but before he could do anything else, Uncle 

Page | 55 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Vernon shouted, “ Will you get these ruddy things off 
us?” 

Harry looked around; all three of the Dursleys were 
cowering with their arms over their heads as their 
glasses bounced up and down on their skulls, their 
contents flying everywhere. 

“Oh, I’m so sorry,” said Dumbledore politely, and he 
raised his wand again. All three glasses vanished. 

“But it would have been better manners to drink it, 
you know.” 

It looked as though Uncle Vernon was bursting with 
any number of unpleasant retorts, but he merely 
shrank back into the cushions with Aunt Petunia and 
Dudley and said nothing, keeping his small piggy eyes 
on Dumbledore ’s wand. 

“You see,” Dumbledore said, turning back to Harry 
and again speaking as though Uncle Vernon had not 
uttered, “if you have indeed inherited the house, you 
have also inherited — ” 

He flicked his wand for a fifth time. There was a loud 
crack, and a house-elf appeared, with a snout for a 
nose, giant bat’s ears, and enormous bloodshot eyes, 
crouching on the Dursleys’ shag carpet and covered 
in grimy rags. Aunt Petunia let out a hair-raising 
shriek; nothing this filthy had entered her house in 
living memory. Dudley drew his large, bare, pink feet 
off the floor and sat with them raised almost above 
his head, as though he thought the creature might 
run up his pajama trousers, and Uncle Vernon 
bellowed, “What the hell is that?” 

“Kreacher,” finished Dumbledore. 



Page | 56 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Kreacher won’t, Kreacher won’t, Kreacher won’t!” 
croaked the house-elf, quite as loudly as Uncle 
Vernon, stamping his long, gnarled feet and pulling 
his ears. “Kreacher belongs to Miss Bellatrix, oh yes, 
Kreacher belongs to the Blacks, Kreacher wants his 
new mistress, Kreacher won’t go to the Potter brat, 
Kreacher won’t, won’t, won’t — ” 

“As you can see, Harry,” said Dumbledore loudly, over 
Kreacher’s continued croaks of “won’t, won’t, won’t,” 
“Kreacher is showing a certain reluctance to pass into 
your ownership.” 

“I don’t care,” said Harry again, looking with disgust 
at the writhing, stamping house-elf. “I don’t want 
him.” 

“Won’t, won’t, won’t, won’t — ” 

“You would prefer him to pass into the ownership of 
Bellatrix Lestrange? Bearing in mind that he has lived 
at the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix for 
the past year?” 

“Won’t, won’t, won’t, won’t — ” 

Harry stared at Dumbledore. He knew that Kreacher 
could not be permitted to go and live with Bellatrix 
Lestrange, but the idea of owning him, of having 
responsibility for the creature that had betrayed 
Sirius, was repugnant. 

“Give him an order,” said Dumbledore. “If he has 
passed into your ownership, he will have to obey. If 
not, then we shall have to think of some other means 
of keeping him from his rightful mistress.” 

“Won’t, won’t, won’t, WON’T.” 



Page | 57 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Kreacher’s voice had risen to a scream. Harry could 
think of nothing to say, except, “Kreacher, shut up!” 

It looked for a moment as though Kreacher was going 
to choke. He grabbed his throat, his mouth still 
working furiously, his eyes bulging. After a few 
seconds of frantic gulping, he threw himself face 
forward onto the carpet (Aunt Petunia whimpered) 
and beat the floor with his hands and feet, giving 
himself over to a violent, but entirely silent, tantrum. 

“Well, that simplifies matters,” said Dumbledore 
cheerfully. “It seems that Sirius knew what he was 
doing. You are the rightful owner of number twelve, 
Grimmauld Place and of Kreacher.” 

“Do I — do I have to keep him with me?” Harry asked, 
aghast, as Kreacher thrashed around at his feet. 

“Not if you don’t want to,” said Dumbledore. “If I 
might make a suggestion, you could send him to 
Hogwarts to work in the kitchen there. In that way, 
the other house-elves could keep an eye on him.” 

“Yeah,” said Harry in relief, “yeah, I’ll do that. Er — 
Kreacher — I want you to go to Hogwarts and work in 
the kitchens there with the other house-elves.” 

Kreacher, who was now lying flat on his back with his 
arms and legs in the air, gave Harry one upside-down 
look of deepest loathing and, with another loud crack, 
vanished. 

“Good,” said Dumbledore. “There is also the matter of 
the hippogriff, Buckbeak. Hagrid has been looking 
after him since Sirius died, but Buckbeak is yours 
now, so if you would prefer to make different 
arrangements — ” 



Page | 58 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“No,” said Harry at once, “he can stay with Hagrid. I 
think Buckbeak would prefer that.” 

“Hagrid will be delighted,” said Dumbledore, smiling. 
“He was thrilled to see Buckbeak again. Incidentally, 
we have decided, in the interests of Buckbeak’s 
safety, to rechristen him ‘Witherwings’ for the time 
being, though I doubt that the Ministry would ever 
guess he is the hippogriff they once sentenced to 
death. Now, Harry, is your trunk packed?” 

“Erm ...” 

“Doubtful that I would turn up?” Dumbledore 
suggested shrewdly. 

“I’ll just go and — er — finish off,” said Harry hastily, 
hurrying to pick up his fallen telescope and trainers. 

It took him a little over ten minutes to track down 
everything he needed; at last he had managed to 
extract his Invisibility Cloak from under the bed, 
screwed the top back on his jar of color-change ink, 
and forced the lid of his trunk shut on his cauldron. 
Then, heaving his trunk in one hand and holding 
Hedwig’s cage in the other, he made his way back 
downstairs. 

He was disappointed to discover that Dumbledore was 
not waiting in the hall, which meant that he had to 
return to the living room. 

Nobody was talking. Dumbledore was humming 
quietly, apparently quite at his ease, but the 
atmosphere was thicker than cold custard, and Harry 
did not dare look at the Dursleys as he said, 

“Professor — I’m ready now.” 



Page | 59 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Good,” said Dumbledore. “Just one last thing, then.” 
And he turned to speak to the Dursleys once more. 

“As you will no doubt be aware, Harry comes of age in 
a year’s time — ” 

“No,” said Aunt Petunia, speaking for the first time 
since Dumbledore’s arrival. 

“I’m sorry?” said Dumbledore politely. 

“No, he doesn’t. He’s a month younger than Dudley, 
and Dudders doesn’t turn eighteen until the year after 
next.” 

“Ah,” said Dumbledore pleasantly, “but in the 
Wizarding world, we come of age at seventeen.” 

Uncle Vernon muttered, “Preposterous,” but 
Dumbledore ignored him. 

“Now, as you already know, the wizard called Lord 
Voldemort has returned to this country. The 
Wizarding community is currently in a state of open 
warfare. Harry, whom Lord Voldemort has already 
attempted to kill on a number of occasions, is in even 
greater danger now than the day when I left him upon 
your doorstep fifteen years ago, with a letter 
explaining about his parents’ murder and expressing 
the hope that you would care for him as though he 
were your own.” 

Dumbledore paused, and although his voice remained 
light and calm, and he gave no obvious sign of anger, 
Harry felt a kind of chill emanating from him and 
noticed that the Dursleys drew very slightly closer 
together. 



Page | 60 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“You did not do as I asked. You have never treated 
Harry as a son. He has known nothing but neglect 
and often cruelty at your hands. The best that can be 
said is that he has at least escaped the appalling 
damage you have inflicted upon the unfortunate boy 
sitting between you.” 

Both Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon looked around 
instinctively, as though expecting to see someone 
other than Dudley squeezed between them. 

“Us — mistreat Dudders? What d’you — ?” began 
Uncle Vernon furiously, but Dumbledore raised his 
finger for silence, a silence which fell as though he 
had struck Uncle Vernon dumb. 

“The magic I evoked fifteen years ago means that 
Harry has powerful protection while he can still call 
this house ‘home.’ However miserable he has been 
here, however unwelcome, however badly treated, you 
have at least, grudgingly, allowed him houseroom. 
This magic will cease to operate the moment that 
Harry turns seventeen; in other words, at the moment 
he becomes a man. I ask only this: that you allow 
Harry to return, once more, to this house, before his 
seventeenth birthday, which will ensure that the 
protection continues until that time.” 

None of the Dursleys said anything. Dudley was 
frowning slightly, as though he was still trying to 
work out when he had ever been mistreated. Uncle 
Vernon looked as though he had something stuck in 
his throat; Aunt Petunia, however, was oddly flushed. 

“Well, Harry ... time for us to be off,” said Dumbledore 
at last, standing up and straightening his long black 
cloak. “Until we meet again,” he said to the Dursleys, 
who looked as though that moment could wait forever 



Page | 61 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




as far as they were concerned, and after doffing his 
hat, he swept from the room. 

“Bye,” said Harry hastily to the Dursleys, and followed 
Dumbledore, who paused beside Harry’s trunk, upon 
which Hedwig’s cage was perched. 

“We do not want to be encumbered by these just 
now,” he said, pulling out his wand again. “I shall 
send them to the Burrow to await us there. However, I 
would like you to bring your Invisibility Cloak ... just 
in case.” 

Harry extracted his cloak from his trunk with some 
difficulty, trying not to show Dumbledore the mess 
within. When he had stuffed it into an inside pocket 
of his jacket, Dumbledore waved his wand and the 
trunk, cage, and Hedwig vanished. Dumbledore then 
waved his wand again, and the front door opened 
onto cool, misty darkness. 

“And now, Harry, let us step out into the night and 
pursue that flighty temptress, adventure.”

HORACE SLUGHORN 

Despite the fact that he had spent every waking 
moment of the past few days hoping desperately that 
Dumbledore would indeed come to fetch him, Harry 
felt distinctly awkward as they set off down Privet 
Drive together. He had never had a proper 
conversation with the headmaster outside of 
Hogwarts before; there was usually a desk between 
them. The memory of their last face-to-face encounter 
kept intruding too, and it rather heightened Harry’s 
sense of embarrassment; he had shouted a lot on that 
occasion, not to mention done his best to smash 
several of Dumbledore ’s most prized possessions. 

Dumbledore, however, seemed completely relaxed. 

“Keep your wand at the ready, Harry,” he said 
brightly. 

“But I thought I’m not allowed to use magic outside 
school, sir?” 



Page | 63 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 



“If there is an attack,” said Dumbledore, “I give you 
permission to use any counterjinx or curse that might 
occur to you. However, I do not think you need worry 
about being attacked tonight.” 

“Why not, sir?” 

“You are with me,” said Dumbledore simply. “This will 
do, Harry.” 

He came to an abrupt halt at the end of Privet Drive. 

“You have not, of course, passed your Apparition 
Test,” he said. 

“No,” said Harry. “I thought you had to be seventeen?” 

“You do,” said Dumbledore. “So you will need to hold 
on to my arm very tightly. My left, if you don’t mind — 
as you have noticed, my wand arm is a little fragile at 
the moment.” 

Harry gripped Dumbledore’s proffered forearm. 

“Very good,” said Dumbledore. “Well, here we go.” 

Harry felt Dumbledore’s arm twist away from him and 
redoubled his grip; the next thing he knew, everything 
went black; he was being pressed very hard from all 
directions; he could not breathe, there were iron 
bands tightening around his chest; his eyeballs were 
being forced back into his head; his eardrums were 
being pushed deeper into his skull and then — 

He gulped great lungfuls of cold night air and opened 
his streaming eyes. He felt as though he had just 
been forced through a very tight rubber tube. It was a 
few seconds before he realized that Privet Drive had 
vanished. He and Dumbledore were now standing in 
Page | 64 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




what appeared to be a deserted village square, in the 
center of which stood an old war memorial and a few 
benches. His comprehension catching up with his 
senses, Harry realized that he had just Apparated for 
the first time in his life. 

“Are you all right?” asked Dumbledore, looking down 
at him solicitously. “The sensation does take some 
getting used to.” 

“I’m fine,” said Harry, rubbing his ears, which felt as 
though they had left Privet Drive rather reluctantly. 
“But I think I might prefer brooms. ...” 

Dumbledore smiled, drew his traveling cloak a little 
more tightly around his neck, and said, “This way.” 

He set off at a brisk pace, past an empty inn and a 
few houses. According to a clock on a nearby church, 
it was almost midnight. 

“So tell me, Harry,” said Dumbledore. “Your scar ... 
has it been hurting at all?” 

Harry raised a hand unconsciously to his forehead 
and rubbed the lightning-shaped mark. 

“No,” he said, “and IVe been wondering about that. I 
thought it would be burning all the time now 
Voldemort’s getting so powerful again.” 

He glanced up at Dumbledore and saw that he was 
wearing a satisfied expression. 

“I, on the other hand, thought otherwise,” said 
Dumbledore. “Lord Voldemort has finally realized the 
dangerous access to his thoughts and feelings you 
have been enjoying. It appears that he is now 
employing Occlumency against you.” 

Page | 65 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Well, I’m not complaining,” said Harry, who missed 
neither the disturbing dreams nor the startling 
flashes of insight into Voldemort’s mind. 

They turned a corner, passing a telephone box and a 
bus shelter. Harry looked sideways at Dumbledore 
again. “Professor?” 

“Harry?” 

“Er — where exactly are we?” 

“This, Harry, is the charming village of Budleigh 
Babberton.” 

“And what are we doing here?” 

“Ah yes, of course, I haven’t told you,” said 
Dumbledore. “Well, I have lost count of the number of 
times I have said this in recent years, but we are, 
once again, one member of staff short. We are here to 
persuade an old colleague of mine to come out of 
retirement and return to Hogwarts.” 

“How can I help with that, sir?” 

“Oh, I think we’ll find a use for you,” said Dumbledore 
vaguely. “Left here, Harry.” 

They proceeded up a steep, narrow street lined with 
houses. All the windows were dark. The odd chill that 
had lain over Privet Drive for two weeks persisted here 
too. Thinking of dementors, Harry cast a look over his 
shoulder and grasped his wand reassuringly in his 
pocket. 

“Professor, why couldn’t we just Apparate directly into 
your old colleague’s house?” 



Page | 66 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Because it would be quite as rude as kicking down 
the front door,” said Dumbledore. “Courtesy dictates 
that we offer fellow wizards the opportunity of denying 
us entry. In any case, most Wizarding dwellings are 
magically protected from unwanted Apparators. At 
Hogwarts, for instance — ” 

“ — you can’t Apparate anywhere inside the buildings 
or grounds,” said Harry quickly. “Hermione Granger 
told me.” 

“And she is quite right. We turn left again.” 

The church clock chimed midnight behind them. 

Harry wondered why Dumbledore did not consider it 
rude to call on his old colleague so late, but now that 
conversation had been established, he had more 
pressing questions to ask. 

“Sir, I saw in the Daily Prophet that Fudge has been 
sacked. ...” 

“Correct,” said Dumbledore, now turning up a steep 
side street. “He has been replaced, as I am sure you 
also saw, by Rufus Scrimgeour, who used to be Head 
of the Auror office.” 

“Is he ... Do you think he’s good?” asked Harry. 

“An interesting question,” said Dumbledore. “He is 
able, certainly. A more decisive and forceful 
personality than Cornelius.” 

“Yes, but I meant — ” 

“I know what you meant. Rufus is a man of action 
and, having fought Dark wizards for most of his 
working life, does not underestimate Lord Voldemort.” 



Page | 67 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Harry waited, but Dumbledore did not say anything 
about the disagreement with Scrimgeour that the 
Daily Prophet had reported, and he did not have the 
nerve to pursue the subject, so he changed it. “And ... 
sir ... I saw about Madam Bones.” 

“Yes,” said Dumbledore quietly. “A terrible loss. She 
was a great witch. Just up here, I think — ouch.” 

He had pointed with his injured hand. 

“Professor, what happened to your — ?” 

“I have no time to explain now,” said Dumbledore. “It 
is a thrilling tale, I wish to do it justice.” 

He smiled at Harry, who understood that he was not 
being snubbed, and that he had permission to keep 
asking questions. 

“Sir — I got a Ministry of Magic leaflet by owl, about 
security measures we should all take against the 
Death Eaters. ...” 

“Yes, I received one myself,” said Dumbledore, still 
smiling. “Did you find it useful?” 

“Not really.” 

“No, I thought not. You have not asked me, for 
instance, what is my favorite flavor of jam, to check 
that I am indeed Professor Dumbledore and not an 
impostor.” 

“I didn’t ...” Harry began, not entirely sure whether he 
was being reprimanded or not. 

“For future reference, Harry, it is raspberry ... 
although of course, if I were a Death Eater, I would 

Page | 68 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




have been sure to research my own jam preferences 
before impersonating myself.” 

“Er ... right,” said Harry. “Well, on that leaflet, it said 
something about Inferi. What exactly are they? The 
leaflet wasn’t very clear.” 

“They are corpses,” said Dumbledore calmly. “Dead 
bodies that have been bewitched to do a Dark 
wizard’s bidding. Inferi have not been seen for a long 
time, however, not since Voldemort was last powerful. 

. . . He killed enough people to make an army of them, 
of course. This is the place, Harry, just here. ...” 

They were nearing a small, neat stone house set in its 
own garden. Harry was too busy digesting the horrible 
idea of Inferi to have much attention left for anything 
else, but as they reached the front gate, Dumbledore 
stopped dead and Harry walked into him. 

“Oh dear. Oh dear, dear, dear.” 

Harry followed his gaze up the carefully tended front 
path and felt his heart sink. The front door was 
hanging off its hinges. 

Dumbledore glanced up and down the street. It 
seemed quite deserted. 

“Wand out and follow me, Harry,” he said quietly. 

He opened the gate and walked swiftly and silently up 
the garden path, Harry at his heels, then pushed the 
front door very slowly, his wand raised and at the 
ready. 

“Lumos.” 



Page | 69 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Dumbledore ’s wand tip ignited, casting its light up a 
narrow hallway. To the left, another door stood open. 
Holding his illuminated wand aloft, Dumbledore 
walked into the sitting room with Harry right behind 
him. 

A scene of total devastation met their eyes. A 
grandfather clock lay splintered at their feet, its face 
cracked, its pendulum lying a little farther away like a 
dropped sword. A piano was on its side, its keys 
strewn across the floor. The wreckage of a fallen 
chandelier glittered nearby. Cushions lay deflated, 
feathers oozing from slashes in their sides; fragments 
of glass and china lay like powder over everything. 
Dumbledore raised his wand even higher, so that its 
light was thrown upon the walls, where something 
darkly red and glutinous was spattered over the 
wallpaper. Harry’s small intake of breath made 
Dumbledore look around. 

“Not pretty, is it?” he said heavily. “Yes, something 
horrible has happened here.” 

Dumbledore moved carefully into the middle of the 
room, scrutinizing the wreckage at his feet. Harry 
followed, gazing around, half-scared of what he might 
see hidden behind the wreck of the piano or the 
overturned sofa, but there was no sign of a body. 

“Maybe there was a fight and — and they dragged him 
off, Professor?” Harry suggested, trying not to imagine 
how badly wounded a man would have to be to leave 
those stains spattered halfway up the walls. 

“I don’t think so,” said Dumbledore quietly, peering 
behind an overstuffed armchair lying on its side. 

“You mean he’s — ?” 



Page | 70 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Still here somewhere? Yes.” 



And without warning, Dumbledore swooped, plunging 
the tip of his wand into the seat of the overstuffed 
armchair, which yelled, “Ouch!” 

“Good evening, Horace,” said Dumbledore, 
straightening up again. 

Harry’s jaw dropped. Where a split second before 
there had been an armchair, there now crouched an 
enormously fat, bald, old man who was massaging his 
lower belly and squinting up at Dumbledore with an 
aggrieved and watery eye. 

“There was no need to stick the wand in that hard,” 
he said gruffly, clambering to his feet. “It hurt.” 

The wandlight sparkled on his shiny pate, his 
prominent eyes, his enormous, silver, walruslike 
mustache, and the highly polished buttons on the 
maroon velvet jacket he was wearing over a pair of 
lilac silk pajamas. The top of his head barely reached 
Dumbledore ’s chin. 

“What gave it away?” he grunted as he staggered to 
his feet, still rubbing his lower belly. He seemed 
remarkably unabashed for a man who had just been 
discovered pretending to be an armchair. 

“My dear Horace,” said Dumbledore, looking amused, 
“if the Death Eaters really had come to call, the Dark 
Mark would have been set over the house.” 

The wizard clapped a pudgy hand to his vast 
forehead. 

“The Dark Mark,” he muttered. “Knew there was 
something ... ah well. Wouldn’t have had time 

Page | 71 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling 




anyway, I’d only just put the finishing touches to my 
upholstery when you entered the room.” 

He heaved a great sigh that made the ends of his 
mustache flutter. 

“Would you like my assistance clearing up?” asked 
Dumbledore politely. 

“Please,” said the other. 

They stood back to back, the tall thin wizard and the 
short round one, and waved their wands in one 
identical sweeping motion. 

The furniture flew back to its original places; 
ornaments reformed in midair, feathers zoomed into 
their cushions; torn books repaired themselves as 
they landed upon their shelves; oil lanterns soared 
onto side tables and reignited; a vast collection of 
splintered silver picture frames flew glittering across 
the room and alighted, whole and untarnished, upon 
a desk; rips, cracks, and holes healed everywhere, 
and the walls wiped themselves clean. 

“What kind of blood was that, incidentally?” asked 
Dumbledore loudly over the chiming of the newly 
unsmashed grandfather clock. 

“On the walls? Dragon,” shouted the wizard called 
Horace, as, with a deafening grinding and tinkling, 
the chandelier screwed itself back into the ceiling. 

There was a final plunk from the piano, and silence. 

“Yes, dragon,” repeated the wizard conversationally. 
“My last bottle, and prices are sky-high at the 
moment. Still, it might be reusable.” 



Page | 72 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




He stumped over to a small crystal bottle standing on 
top of a sideboard and held it up to the light, 
examining the thick liquid within. 

“Hmm. Bit dusty.” 

He set the bottle back on the sideboard and sighed. It 
was then that his gaze fell upon Harry. 

“Oho,” he said, his large round eyes flying to Harry’s 
forehead and the lightning-shaped scar it bore. “Ohol” 

“This,” said Dumbledore, moving forward to make the 
introduction, “is Harry Potter. Harry, this is an old 
friend and colleague of mine, Horace Slughorn.” 

Slughorn turned on Dumbledore, his expression 
shrewd. “So that’s how you thought you’d persuade 
me, is it? Well, the answer’s no, Albus.” 

He pushed past Harry, his face turned resolutely 
away with the air of a man trying to resist temptation. 

“I suppose we can have a drink, at least?” asked 
Dumbledore. “For old time’s sake?” 

Slughorn hesitated. 

“All right then, one drink,” he said ungraciously. 

Dumbledore smiled at Harry and directed him toward 
a chair not unlike the one that Slughorn had so 
recently impersonated, which stood right beside the 
newly burning fire and a brightly glowing oil lamp. 
Harry took the seat with the distinct impression that 
Dumbledore, for some reason, wanted to keep him as 
visible as possible. Certainly when Slughorn, who had 
been busy with decanters and glasses, turned to face 
the room again, his eyes fell immediately upon Harry. 
Page | 73 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Hmpf,” he said, looking away quickly as though 
frightened of hurting his eyes. “Here — ” He gave a 
drink to Dumbledore, who had sat down without 
invitation, thrust the tray at Harry, and then sank 
into the cushions of the repaired sofa and a 
disgruntled silence. His legs were so short they did 
not touch the floor. 

“Well, how have you been keeping, Horace?” 
Dumbledore asked. 

“Not so well,” said Slughorn at once. “Weak chest. 
Wheezy. Rheumatism too. Can’t move like I used to. 
Well, that’s to be expected. Old age. Fatigue.” 

“And yet you must have moved fairly quickly to 
prepare such a welcome for us at such short notice,” 
said Dumbledore. “You can’t have had more than 
three minutes’ warning?” 

Slughorn said, half irritably, half proudly, “Two. 

Didn’t hear my Intruder Charm go off, I was taking a 
bath. Still,” he added sternly, seeming to pull himself 
back together again, “the fact remains that I’m an old 
man, Albus. A tired old man who’s earned the right to 
a quiet life and a few creature comforts.” 

He certainly had those, thought Harry, looking 
around the room. It was stuffy and cluttered, yet 
nobody could say it was uncomfortable; there were 
soft chairs and footstools, drinks and books, boxes of 
chocolates and plump cushions. If Harry had not 
known who lived there, he would have guessed at a 
rich, fussy old lady. 

“You’re not yet as old as I am, Horace,” said 
Dumbledore. 



Page | 74 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Well, maybe you ought to think about retirement 
yourself,” said Slughorn bluntly. His pale gooseberry 
eyes had found Dumbledore ’s injured hand. 

“Reactions not what they were, I see.” 

“You’re quite right,” said Dumbledore serenely, 
shaking back his sleeve to reveal the tips of those 
burned and blackened fingers; the sight of them made 
the back of Harry’s neck prickle unpleasantly. “I am 
undoubtedly slower than I was. But on the other 
hand ...” 

He shrugged and spread his hands wide, as though to 
say that age had its compensations, and Harry 
noticed a ring on his uninjured hand that he had 
never seen Dumbledore wear before: It was large, 
rather clumsily made of what looked like gold, and 
was set with a heavy black stone that had cracked 
down the middle. Slughorn’s eyes lingered for a 
moment on the ring too, and Harry saw a tiny frown 
momentarily crease his wide forehead. 

“So, all these precautions against intruders, Horace 
... are they for the Death Eaters’ benefit, or mine?” 
asked Dumbledore. 

“What would the Death Eaters want with a poor 
broken-down old buffer like me?” demanded 
Slughorn. 

“I imagine that they would want you to turn your 
considerable talents to coercion, torture, and 
murder,” said Dumbledore. “Are you really telling me 
that they haven’t come recruiting yet?” 

Slughorn eyed Dumbledore balefully for a moment, 
then muttered, “I haven’t given them the chance. I’ve 
been on the move for a year. Never stay in one place 
more than a week. Move from Muggle house to 

Page | 75 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Muggle house — the owners of this place are on 
holiday in the Canary Islands — it’s been very 
pleasant, I’ll be sorry to leave. It’s quite easy once you 
know how, one simple Freezing Charm on these 
absurd burglar alarms they use instead of 
Sneakoscopes and make sure the neighbors don’t 
spot you bringing in the piano.” 

“Ingenious,” said Dumbledore. “But it sounds a rather 
tiring existence for a broken-down old buffer in 
search of a quiet life. Now, if you were to return to 
Hogwarts — ” 

“If you’re going to tell me my life would be more 
peaceful at that pestilential school, you can save your 
breath, Albus! I might have been in hiding, but some 
funny rumors have reached me since Dolores 
Umbridge left! If that’s how you treat teachers these 
days — ” 

“Professor Umbridge ran afoul of our centaur herd,” 
said Dumbledore. “I think you, Horace, would have 
known better than to stride into the forest and call a 
horde of angry centaurs ‘filthy half-breeds.’ ” 

“That’s what she did, did she?” said Slughorn. “Idiotic 
woman. Never liked her.” 

Harry chuckled and both Dumbledore and Slughorn 
looked round at him. 

“Sorry,” Harry said hastily. “It’s just — I didn’t like 
her either.” 

Dumbledore stood up rather suddenly. 

“Are you leaving?” asked Slughorn at once, looking 
hopeful. 



Page | 76 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“No, I was wondering whether I might use your 
bathroom,” said Dumbledore. 

“Oh,” said Slughorn, clearly disappointed. “Second on 
the left down the hall.” 

Dumbledore strode from the room. Once the door had 
closed behind him, there was silence. After a few 
moments, Slughorn got to his feet but seemed 
uncertain what to do with himself. He shot a furtive 
look at Harry, then crossed to the fire and turned his 
back on it, warming his wide behind. 

“Don’t think I don’t know why he’s brought you,” he 
said abruptly. 

Harry merely looked at Slughorn. Slughorn ’s watery 
eyes slid over Harry’s scar, this time taking in the rest 
of his face. 

“You look very like your father.” 

“Yeah, I’ve been told,” said Harry. 

“Except for your eyes. You’ve got — ” 

“My mother’s eyes, yeah.” Harry had heard it so often 
he found it a bit wearing. 

“Hmpf. Yes, well. You shouldn’t have favorites as a 
teacher, of course, but she was one of mine. Your 
mother,” Slughorn added, in answer to Harry’s 
questioning look. “Lily Evans. One of the brightest I 
ever taught. Vivacious, you know. Charming girl. I 
used to tell her she ought to have been in my House. 
Very cheeky answers I used to get back too.” 

“Which was your House?” 



Page | 77 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“I was Head of Slytherin,” said Slughorn. “Oh, now,” 
he went on quickly, seeing the expression on Harry’s 
face and wagging a stubby finger at him, “don’t go 
holding that against me! You’ll be Gryffindor like her, 

I suppose? Yes, it usually goes in families. Not 
always, though. Ever heard of Sirius Black? You must 
have done — been in the papers for the last couple of 
years — died a few weeks ago — ” 

It was as though an invisible hand had twisted 
Harry’s intestines and held them tight. 

“Well, anyway, he was a big pal of your father’s at 
school. The whole Black family had been in my 
House, but Sirius ended up in Gryffindor! Shame — 
he was a talented boy. I got his brother, Regulus, 
when he came along, but I’d have liked the set.” 

He sounded like an enthusiastic collector who had 
been outbid at auction. Apparently lost in memories, 
he gazed at the opposite wall, turning idly on the spot 
to ensure an even heat on his backside. 

“Your mother was Muggle-born, of course. Couldn’t 
believe it when I found out. Thought she must have 
been pure-blood, she was so good.” 

“One of my best friends is Muggle-born,” said Harry, 
“and she’s the best in our year.” 

“Funny how that sometimes happens, isn’t it?” said 
Slughorn. 

“Not really,” said Harry coldly. 

Slughorn looked down at him in surprise. “You 
mustn’t think I’m prejudiced!” he said. “No, no, no! 
Haven’t I just said your mother was one of my all-time 
favorite students? And there was Dirk Cresswell in 

Page | 78 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




the year after her too — now Head of the Goblin 
Liaison Office, of course — another Muggle-born, a 
very gifted student, and still gives me excellent inside 
information on the goings-on at Gringotts!” 

He bounced up and down a little, smiling in a self- 
satisfied way, and pointed at the many glittering 
photograph frames on the dresser, each peopled with 
tiny moving occupants. 

“All ex-students, all signed. You’ll notice Barnabas 
Cuffe, editor of the Daily Prophet, he’s always 
interested to hear my take on the day’s news. And 
Ambrosius Flume, of Honeydukes — a hamper every 
birthday, and all because I was able to give him an 
introduction to Ciceron Harkiss, who gave him his 
first job! And at the back — you’ll see her if you just 
crane your neck — that’s Gwenog Jones, who of 
course captains the Holyhead Harpies. ... People are 
always astonished to hear I’m on first-name terms 
with the Harpies, and free tickets whenever I want 
them!” 

This thought seemed to cheer him up enormously. 

“And all these people know where to find you, to send 
you stuff?” asked Harry, who could not help 
wondering why the Death Eaters had not yet tracked 
down Slughorn if hampers of sweets, Quidditch 
tickets, and visitors craving his advice and opinions 
could find him. 

The smile slid from Slughorn ’s face as quickly as the 
blood from his walls. 

“Of course not,” he said, looking down at Harry. “I 
have been out of touch with everybody for a year.” 



Page | 79 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Harry had the impression that the words shocked 
Slughorn himself; he looked quite unsettled for a 
moment. Then he shrugged. 

“Still . . . the prudent wizard keeps his head down in 
such times. All very well for Dumbledore to talk, but 
taking up a post at Hogwarts just now would be 
tantamount to declaring my public allegiance to the 
Order of the Phoenix! And while I’m sure they’re very 
admirable and brave and all the rest of it, I don’t 
personally fancy the mortality rate — ” 

“You don’t have to join the Order to teach at 
Hogwarts,” said Harry, who could not quite keep a 
note of derision out of his voice: It was hard to 
sympathize with Slughorn ’s cosseted existence when 
he remembered Sirius, crouching in a cave and living 
on rats. “Most of the teachers aren’t in it, and none of 
them has ever been killed — well, unless you count 
Quirrell, and he got what he deserved seeing as he 
was working with Voldemort.” 

Harry had been sure Slughorn would be one of those 
wizards who could not bear to hear Voldemort’s name 
spoken aloud, and was not disappointed: Slughorn 
gave a shudder and a squawk of protest, which Harry 
ignored. 

“I reckon the staff are safer than most people while 
Dumbledore ’s headmaster; he’s supposed to be the 
only one Voldemort ever feared, isn’t he?” Harry went 
on. 

Slughorn gazed into space for a moment or two: He 
seemed to be thinking over Harry’s words. 

“Well, yes, it is true that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named 
has never sought a fight with Dumbledore,” he 
muttered grudgingly. “And I suppose one could argue 

Page | 80 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




that as I have not joined the Death Eaters, He-Who- 
Must-Not-Be-Named can hardly count me a friend ... 
in which case, I might well be safer a little closer to 
Albus. ... I cannot pretend that Amelia Bones’s death 
did not shake me. ... If she, with all her Ministry 
contacts and protection ...” 

Dumbledore reentered the room and Slughorn 
jumped as though he had forgotten he was in the 
house. 

“Oh, there you are, Albus,” he said. “You’ve been a 
very long time. Upset stomach?” 

“No, I was merely reading the Muggle magazines,” 
said Dumbledore. “I do love knitting patterns. Well, 
Harry, we have trespassed upon Horace’s hospitality 
quite long enough; I think it is time for us to leave.” 

Not at all reluctant to obey, Harry jumped to his feet. 
Slughorn seemed taken aback. 

“You’re leaving?” 

“Yes, indeed. I think I know a lost cause when I see 
one.” 

“Lost... ?” 

Slughorn seemed agitated. He twiddled his fat 
thumbs and fidgeted as he watched Dumbledore 
fasten his traveling cloak, and Harry zip up his jacket. 

“Well, I’m sorry you don’t want the job, Horace,” said 
Dumbledore, raising his uninjured hand in a farewell 
salute. “Hogwarts would have been glad to see you 
back again. Our greatly increased security 
notwithstanding, you will always be welcome to visit, 
should you wish to.” 

Page | 81 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling 




“Yes ... well ... very gracious ... as I say ...” 



“Good-bye, then.” 

“Bye,” said Harry. 

They were at the front door when there was a shout 
from behind them. 

“All right, all right, 111 do it!” 

Dumbledore turned to see Slughorn standing 
breathless in the doorway to the sitting room. 

“You will come out of retirement?” 

“Yes, yes,” said Slughorn impatiently. “I must be mad, 
but yes.” 

“Wonderful,” said Dumbledore, beaming. “Then, 
Horace, we shall see you on the first of September.” 

“Yes, I daresay you will,” grunted Slughorn. 

As they set off down the garden path, Slughorn ’s voice 
floated after them, “111 want a pay rise, Dumbledore!” 

Dumbledore chuckled. The garden gate swung shut 
behind them, and they set off back down the hill 
through the dark and the swirling mist. 

“Well done, Harry,” said Dumbledore. 

“I didn’t do anything,” said Harry in surprise. 

“Oh yes you did. You showed Horace exactly how 
much he stands to gain by returning to Hogwarts. Did 
you like him?” 



Page | 82 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Er ...” 



Harry wasn’t sure whether he liked Slughorn or not. 
He supposed he had been pleasant in his way, but he 
had also seemed vain and, whatever he said to the 
contrary, much too surprised that a Muggle-born 
should make a good witch. 

“Horace,” said Dumbledore, relieving Harry of the 
responsibility to say any of this, “likes his comfort. He 
also likes the company of the famous, the successful, 
and the powerful. He enjoys the feeling that he 
influences these people. He has never wanted to 
occupy the throne himself; he prefers the backseat — 
more room to spread out, you see. He used to 
handpick favorites at Hogwarts, sometimes for their 
ambition or their brains, sometimes for their charm 
or their talent, and he had an uncanny knack for 
choosing those who would go on to become 
outstanding in their various fields. Horace formed a 
kind of club of his favorites with himself at the center, 
making introductions, forging useful contacts 
between members, and always reaping some kind of 
benefit in return, whether a free box of his favorite 
crystalized pineapple or the chance to recommend the 
next junior member of the Goblin Liaison Office.” 

Harry had a sudden and vivid mental image of a great 
swollen spider, spinning a web around it, twitching a 
thread here and there to bring its large and juicy flies 
a little closer. 

“I tell you all this,” Dumbledore continued, “not to 
turn you against Horace — or, as we must now call 
him, Professor Slughorn — but to put you on your 
guard. He will undoubtedly try to collect you, Harry. 
You would be the jewel of his collection; ‘the Boy Who 
Lived’ ... or, as they call you these days, ‘the Chosen 
One.’” 

Page | 83 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




At these words, a chill that had nothing to do with the 
surrounding mist stole over Harry. He was reminded 
of words he had heard a few weeks ago, words that 
had a horrible and particular meaning to him: Neither 
can live while the other survives . . . 

Dumbledore had stopped walking, level with the 
church they had passed earlier. 

“This will do, Harry. If you will grasp my arm.” 

Braced this time, Harry was ready for the Apparition, 
but still found it unpleasant. When the pressure 
disappeared and he found himself able to breathe 
again, he was standing in a country lane beside 
Dumbledore and looking ahead to the crooked 
silhouette of his second favorite building in the world: 
the Burrow. In spite of the feeling of dread that had 
just swept through him, his spirits could not help but 
lift at the sight of it. Ron was in there ... and so was 
Mrs. Weasley, who could cook better than anyone he 
knew. ... 

“If you don’t mind, Harry,” said Dumbledore, as they 
passed through the gate, “I’d like a few words with 
you before we part. In private. Perhaps in here?” 

Dumbledore pointed toward a run-down stone 
outhouse where the Weasleys kept their broomsticks. 
A little puzzled, Harry followed Dumbledore through 
the creaking door into a space a little smaller than the 
average cupboard. Dumbledore illuminated the tip of 
his wand, so that it glowed like a torch, and smiled 
down at Harry. 

“I hope you will forgive me for mentioning it, Harry, 
but I am pleased and a little proud at how well you 
seem to be coping after everything that happened at 



Page | 84 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




the Ministry. Permit me to say that I think Sirius 
would have been proud of you.” 

Harry swallowed; his voice seemed to have deserted 
him. He did not think he could stand to discuss 
Sirius; it had been painful enough to hear Uncle 
Vernon say “His godfather’s dead?” and even worse to 
hear Sirius’s name thrown out casually by Slughorn. 

“It was cruel,” said Dumbledore softly, “that you and 
Sirius had such a short time together. A brutal 
ending to what should have been a long and happy 
relationship.” 

Harry nodded, his eyes fixed resolutely on the spider 
now climbing Dumbledore’s hat. He could tell that 
Dumbledore understood, that he might even suspect 
that until his letter arrived, Harry had spent nearly all 
his time at the Dursleys’ lying on his bed, refusing 
meals, and staring at the misted window, full of the 
chill emptiness that he had come to associate with 
dementors. 

“It’s just hard,” Harry said finally, in a low voice, “to 
realize he won’t write to me again.” 

His eyes burned suddenly and he blinked. He felt 
stupid for admitting it, but the fact that he had had 
someone outside Hogwarts who cared what happened 
to him, almost like a parent, had been one of the best 
things about discovering his godfather . . . and now the 
post owls would never bring him that comfort again. 



“Sirius represented much to you that you had never 
known before,” said Dumbledore gently. “Naturally, 
the loss is devastating. ...” 



Page | 85 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“But while I was at the Dursleys’ ...” interrupted 
Harry, his voice growing stronger, “I realized I can’t 
shut myself away or — or crack up. Sirius wouldn’t 
have wanted that, would he? And anyway, life’s too 
short. ... Look at Madam Bones, look at Emmeline 
Vance. ... It could be me next, couldn’t it? But if it is,” 
he said fiercely, now looking straight into 
Dumbledore’s blue eyes gleaming in the wandlight, 

“I’ll make sure I take as many Death Eaters with me 
as I can, and Voldemort too if I can manage it.” 

“Spoken both like your mother and father’s son and 
Sirius’s true godson!” said Dumbledore, with an 
approving pat on Harry’s back. “I take my hat off to 
you — or I would, if I were not afraid of showering you 
in spiders. 

“And now, Harry, on a closely related subject ... I 
gather that you have been taking the Daily Prophet 
over the last two weeks?” 

“Yes,” said Harry, and his heart beat a little faster. 

“Then you will have seen that there have been not so 
much leaks as floods concerning your adventure in 
the Hall of Prophecy?” 

“Yes,” said Harry again. “And now everyone knows 
that I’m the one — ” 

“No, they do not,” interrupted Dumbledore. “There are 
only two people in the whole world who know the full 
contents of the prophecy made about you and Lord 
Voldemort, and they are both standing in this smelly, 
spidery broom shed. It is true, however, that many 
have guessed, correctly, that Voldemort sent his 
Death Eaters to steal a prophecy, and that the 
prophecy concerned you. 



Page | 86 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Now, I think I am correct in saying that you have not 
told anybody that you know what the prophecy said?” 

“No,” said Harry. 

“A wise decision, on the whole,” said Dumbledore. 
“Although I think you ought to relax it in favor of your 
friends, Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Hermione 
Granger. Yes,” he continued, when Harry looked 
startled, “I think they ought to know. You do them a 
disservice by not confiding something this important 
to them.” 

“I didn’t want — ” 

“ — to worry or frighten them?” said Dumbledore, 
surveying Harry over the top of his half-moon 
spectacles. “Or perhaps, to confess that you yourself 
are worried and frightened? You need your friends, 
Harry. As you so rightly said, Sirius would not have 
wanted you to shut yourself away.” 

Harry said nothing, but Dumbledore did not seem to 
require an answer. He continued, “On a different, 
though related, subject, it is my wish that you take 
private lessons with me this year.” 

“Private — with you?” said Harry, surprised out of his 
preoccupied silence. 

“Yes. I think it is time that I took a greater hand in 
your education.” 

“What will you be teaching me, sir?” 

“Oh, a little of this, a little of that,” said Dumbledore 
airily. 



Page | 87 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Harry waited hopefully, but Dumbledore did not 
elaborate, so he asked something else that had been 
bothering him slightly. 

“If I’m having lessons with you, I won’t have to do 
Occlumency lessons with Snape, will I?” 

“Professor Snape, Harry — and no, you will not.” 

“Good,” said Harry in relief, “because they were a — ” 

He stopped, careful not to say what he really thought. 

“I think the word ‘fiasco’ would be a good one here,” 
said Dumbledore, nodding. 

Harry laughed. 

“Well, that means I won’t see much of Professor 
Snape from now on,” he said, “because he won’t let 
me carry on Potions unless I get ‘Outstanding’ in my 
O.W.L., which I know I haven’t.” 

“Don’t count your owls before they are delivered,” said 
Dumbledore gravely. “Which, now I think of it, ought 
to be some time later today. Now, two more things, 
Harry, before we part. 

“Firstly, I wish you to keep your Invisibility Cloak with 
you at all times from this moment onward. Even 
within Hogwarts itself. Just in case, you understand 
me?” 

Harry nodded. 

“And lastly, while you stay here, the Burrow has been 
given the highest security the Ministry of Magic can 
provide. These measures have caused a certain 
amount of inconvenience to Arthur and Molly — all 

Page | 88 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




their post, for instance, is being searched at the 
Ministry before being sent on. They do not mind in 
the slightest, for their only concern is your safety. 
However, it would be poor repayment if you risked 
your neck while staying with them.” 

“I understand,” said Harry quickly. 

“Very well, then,” said Dumbledore, pushing open the 
broom shed door and stepping out into the yard. “I 
see a light in the kitchen. Let us not deprive Molly 
any longer of the chance to deplore how thin you are.” 



Page | 89 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 







AN EXCESS OF PHLEGM 

Harry and Dumbledore approached the back door of 
the Burrow, which was surrounded by the familiar 
litter of old Wellington boots and rusty cauldrons; 
Harry could hear the soft clucking of sleepy chickens 
coming from a distant shed. Dumbledore knocked 
three times and Harry saw sudden movement behind 
the kitchen window. 

“Who’s there?” said a nervous voice he recognized as 
Mrs. Weasley’s. “Declare yourself!” 

“It is I, Dumbledore, bringing Harry.” 

The door opened at once. There stood Mrs. Weasley, 
short, plump, and wearing an old green dressing 
gown. 

“Harry, dear! Gracious, Albus, you gave me a fright, 
you said not to expect you before morning!” 

“We were lucky,” said Dumbledore, ushering Harry 
over the threshold. “Slughorn proved much more 

Page | 90 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 



persuadable than I had expected. Harry’s doing, of 
course. Ah, hello, Nymphadora!” 

Harry looked around and saw that Mrs. Weasley was 
not alone, despite the lateness of the hour. A young 
witch with a pale, heart-shaped face and mousy 
brown hair was sitting at the table clutching a large 
mug between her hands. 

“Hello, Professor,” she said. “Wotcher, Harry.” 

“Hi, Tonks.” 

Harry thought she looked drawn, even ill, and there 
was something forced in her smile. Certainly her 
appearance was less colorful than usual without her 
customary shade of bubble-gum-pink hair. 

“I’d better be off,” she said quickly, standing up and 
pulling her cloak around her shoulders. “Thanks for 
the tea and sympathy, Molly.” 

“Please don’t leave on my account,” said Dumbledore 
courteously, “I cannot stay, I have urgent matters to 
discuss with Rufus Scrimgeour.” 

“No, no, I need to get going,” said Tonks, not meeting 
Dumbledore’s eyes. “ ’Night — ” 

“Dear, why not come to dinner at the weekend, 

Remus and Mad-Eye are coming — ?” 

“No, really, Molly ... thanks anyway ... Good night, 
everyone.” 

Tonks hurried past Dumbledore and Harry into the 
yard; a few paces beyond the doorstep, she turned on 
the spot and vanished into thin air. Harry noticed 
that Mrs. Weasley looked troubled. 

Page | 91 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling 




“Well, I shall see you at Hogwarts, Harry,” said 
Dumbledore. “Take care of yourself. Molly, your 
servant.” 

He made Mrs. Weasley a bow and followed Tonks, 
vanishing at precisely the same spot. Mrs. Weasley 
closed the door on the empty yard and then steered 
Harry by the shoulders into the full glow of the 
lantern on the table to examine his appearance. 

“You’re like Ron,” she sighed, looking him up and 
down. “Both of you look as though you’ve had 
Stretching Jinxes put on you. I swear Ron’s grown 
four inches since I last bought him school robes. Are 
you hungry, Harry?” 

“Yeah, I am,” said Harry, suddenly realizing just how 
hungry he was. 

“Sit down, dear, I’ll knock something up.” 

As Harry sat down, a furry ginger cat with a squashed 
face jumped onto his knees and settled there, 
purring. 

“So Hermione’s here?” he asked happily as he tickled 
Crookshanks behind the ears. 

“Oh yes, she arrived the day before yesterday,” said 
Mrs. Weasley, rapping a large iron pot with her wand. 
It bounced onto the stove with a loud clang and began 
to bubble at once. “Everyone’s in bed, of course, we 
didn’t expect you for hours. Here you are — ” 

She tapped the pot again; it rose into the air, flew 
toward Harry, and tipped over; Mrs. Weasley slid a 
bowl neatly beneath it just in time to catch the 
stream of thick, steaming onion soup. 



Page | 92 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Bread, dear?” 



“Thanks, Mrs. Weasley.” 

She waved her wand over her shoulder; a loaf of 
bread and a knife soared gracefully onto the table; as 
the loaf sliced itself and the soup pot dropped back 
onto the stove, Mrs. Weasley sat down opposite him. 

“So you persuaded Horace Slughorn to take the job?” 

Harry nodded, his mouth so full of hot soup that he 
could not speak. 

“He taught Arthur and me,” said Mrs. Weasley. “He 
was at Hogwarts for ages, started around the same 
time as Dumbledore, I think. Did you like him?” 

His mouth now full of bread, Harry shrugged and 
gave a noncommittal jerk of the head. 

“I know what you mean,” said Mrs. Weasley, nodding 
wisely. “Of course he can be charming when he wants 
to be, but Arthur’s never liked him much. The 
Ministry’s littered with Slughorn’s old favorites, he 
was always good at giving leg ups, but he never had 
much time for Arthur — didn’t seem to think he was 
enough of a highflier. Well, that just shows you, even 
Slughorn makes mistakes. I don’t know whether 
Ron’s told you in any of his letters — it’s only just 
happened — but Arthur’s been promoted!” 

It could not have been clearer that Mrs. Weasley had 
been bursting to say this. 

Harry swallowed a large amount of very hot soup and 
thought he could feel his throat blistering. “That’s 
great!” he gasped. 



Page | 93 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“You are sweet,” beamed Mrs. Weasley, possibly 
taking his watering eyes for emotion at the news. 

“Yes, Rufus Scrimgeour has set up several new offices 
in response to the present situation, and Arthur’s 
heading the Office for the Detection and Confiscation 
of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects. 
It’s a big job, he’s got ten people reporting to him 
now!” 

“What exactly — ?” 

“Well, you see, in all the panic about You-Know-Who, 
odd things have been cropping up for sale 
everywhere, things that are supposed to guard 
against You-Know-Who and the Death Eaters. You 
can imagine the kind of thing — so-called protective 
potions that are really gravy with a bit of bubotuber 
pus added, or instructions for defensive jinxes that 
actually make your ears fall off. ... Well, in the main 
the perpetrators are just people like Mundungus 
Fletcher, who’ve never done an honest day’s work in 
their lives and are taking advantage of how frightened 
everybody is, but every now and then something 
really nasty turns up. The other day Arthur 
confiscated a box of cursed Sneakoscopes that were 
almost certainly planted by a Death Eater. So you 
see, it’s a very important job, and I tell him it’s just 
silly to miss dealing with spark plugs and toasters 
and all the rest of that Muggle rubbish.” Mrs. Weasley 
ended her speech with a stern look, as if it had been 
Harry suggesting that it was natural to miss spark 
plugs. 

“Is Mr. Weasley still at work?” Harry asked. 

“Yes, he is. As a matter of fact, he’s a tiny bit late. ... 
He said he’d be back around midnight. ...” 



Page | 94 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




She turned to look at a large clock that was perched 
awkwardly on top of a pile of sheets in the washing 
basket at the end of the table. Harry recognized it at 
once: It had nine hands, each inscribed with the 
name of a family member, and usually hung on the 
Weasleys’ sitting room wall, though its current 
position suggested that Mrs. Weasley had taken to 
carrying it around the house with her. Every single 
one of its nine hands was now pointing at “mortal 
peril.” 

“It’s been like that for a while now,” said Mrs. 

Weasley, in an unconvincingly casual voice, “ever 
since You-Know-Who came back into the open. I 
suppose everybody’s in mortal danger now. ... I don’t 
think it can be just our family ... but I don’t know 
anyone else who’s got a clock like this, so I can’t 
check. Oh!” 

With a sudden exclamation she pointed at the clock’s 
face. Mr. Weasley’s hand had switched to “traveling.” 

“He’s coming!” 

And sure enough, a moment later there was a knock 
on the back door. Mrs. Weasley jumped up and 
hurried to it; with one hand on the doorknob and her 
face pressed against the wood she called softly, 
“Arthur, is that you?” 

“Yes,” came Mr. Weasley’s weary voice. “But I would 
say that even if I were a Death Eater, dear. Ask the 
question!” 

“Oh, honestly ...” 

“Molly!” 

“All right, all right . . . What is your dearest ambition?” 

Page | 95 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“To find out how airplanes stay up.” 

Mrs. Weasley nodded and turned the doorknob, but 
apparently Mr. Weasley was holding tight to it on the 
other side, because the door remained firmly shut. 

“Molly! I’ve got to ask you your question first!” 

“Arthur, really, this is just silly. ...” 

“What do you like me to call you when we’re alone 
together?” 

Even by the dim light of the lantern Harry could tell 
that Mrs. Weasley had turned bright red; he himself 
felt suddenly warm around the ears and neck, and 
hastily gulped soup, clattering his spoon as loudly as 
he could against the bowl. 

“Mollywobbles,” whispered a mortified Mrs. Weasley 
into the crack at the edge of the door. 

“Correct,” said Mr. Weasley. “Now you can let me in.” 

Mrs. Weasley opened the door to reveal her husband, 
a thin, balding, red-haired wizard wearing horn- 
rimmed spectacles and a long and dusty traveling 
cloak. 

“I still don’t see why we have to go through that every 
time you come home,” said Mrs. Weasley, still pink in 
the face as she helped her husband out of his cloak. 

“I mean, a Death Eater might have forced the answer 
out of you before impersonating you!” 

“I know, dear, but it’s Ministry procedure, and I have 
to set an example. Something smells good — onion 
soup?” 



Page | 96 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Mr. Weasley turned hopefully in the direction of the 
table. 

“Harry! We didn’t expect you until morning!” 

They shook hands, and Mr. Weasley dropped into the 
chair beside Harry as Mrs. Weasley set a bowl of soup 
in front of him too. 

“Thanks, Molly. It’s been a tough night. Some idiot’s 
started selling Metamorph-Medals. Just sling them 
around your neck and you’ll be able to change your 
appearance at will. A hundred thousand disguises, all 
for ten Galleons!” 

“And what really happens when you put them on?” 

“Mostly you just turn a fairly unpleasant orange color, 
but a couple of people have also sprouted tentaclelike 
warts all over their bodies. As if St. Mungo’s didn’t 
have enough to do already!” 

“It sounds like the sort of thing Fred and George 
would find funny,” said Mrs. Weasley hesitantly. “Are 
you sure — ?” 

“Of course I am!” said Mr. Weasley. “The boys 
wouldn’t do anything like that now, not when people 
are desperate for protection!” 

“So is that why you’re late, Metamorph-Medals?” 

“No, we got wind of a nasty backfiring jinx down in 
Elephant and Castle, but luckily the Magical Law 
Enforcement Squad had sorted it out by the time we 
got there. ...” 

Harry stifled a yawn behind his hand. 



Page | 97 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Bed,” said an undeceived Mrs. Weasley at once. “I’ve 
got Fred and George’s room all ready for you, you’ll 
have it to yourself.” 

“Why, where are they?” 

“Oh, they’re in Diagon Alley, sleeping in the little flat 
over their joke shop as they’re so busy,” said Mrs. 
Weasley. “I must say, I didn’t approve at first, but 
they do seem to have a bit of a flair for business! 

Come on, dear, your trunk’s already up there.” 

“ ’Night, Mr. Weasley,” said Harry, pushing back his 
chair. Crookshanks leapt lightly from his lap and 
slunk out of the room. 

“G’night, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley. 

Harry saw Mrs. Weasley glance at the clock in the 
washing basket as they left the kitchen. All the hands 
were once again at “mortal peril.” 

Fred and George’s bedroom was on the second floor. 
Mrs. Weasley pointed her wand at a lamp on the 
bedside table and it ignited at once, bathing the room 
in a pleasant golden glow. Though a large vase of 
flowers had been placed on a desk in front of the 
small window, their perfume could not disguise the 
lingering smell of what Harry thought was 
gunpowder. A considerable amount of floor space was 
devoted to a vast number of unmarked, sealed 
cardboard boxes, amongst which stood Harry’s school 
trunk. The room looked as though it was being used 
as a temporary warehouse. 

Hedwig hooted happily at Harry from her perch on top 
of a large wardrobe, then took off through the 
window; Harry knew she had been waiting to see him 
before going hunting. Harry bade Mrs. Weasley good 

Page | 98 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




night, put on pajamas, and got into one of the beds. 
There was something hard inside the pillowcase. He 
groped inside it and pulled out a sticky purple-and- 
orange sweet, which he recognized as a Puking 
Pastille. Smiling to himself, he rolled over and was 
instantly asleep. 

Seconds later, or so it seemed to Harry, he was 
awakened by what sounded like cannon fire as the 
door burst open. Sitting bolt upright, he heard the 
rasp of the curtains being pulled back: The dazzling 
sunlight seemed to poke him hard in both eyes. 
Shielding them with one hand, he groped hopelessly 
for his glasses with the other. 

“Wuzzgoinon?” 

“We didn’t know you were here already!” said a loud 
and excited voice, and he received a sharp blow to the 
top of the head. 

“Ron, don’t hit him!” said a girl’s voice reproachfully. 

Harry’s hand found his glasses and he shoved them 
on, though the light was so bright he could hardly see 
anyway. A long, looming shadow quivered in front of 
him for a moment; he blinked and Ron Weasley came 
into focus, grinning down at him. 

“All right?” 

“Never been better,” said Harry, rubbing the top of his 
head and slumping back onto his pillows. “You?” 

“Not bad,” said Ron, pulling over a cardboard box and 
sitting on it. “When did you get here? Mum’s only just 
told us!” 

“About one o’clock this morning.”

“Were the Muggles all right? Did they treat you okay?” 

“Same as usual,” said Harry, as Hermione perched 
herself on the edge of his bed, “they didn’t talk to me 
much, but I like it better that way. How’re you, 
Hermione?” 

“Oh, I’m fine,” said Hermione, who was scrutinizing 
Harry as though he was sickening for something. He 
thought he knew what was behind this, and as he 
had no wish to discuss Sirius’s death or any other 
miserable subject at the moment, he said, “What’s the 
time? Have I missed breakfast?” 

“Don’t worry about that, Mum’s bringing you up a 
tray; she reckons you look underfed,” said Ron, 
rolling his eyes. “So, what’s been going on?” 

“Nothing much, I’ve just been stuck at my aunt and 
uncle’s, haven’t I?” 

“Come off it!” said Ron. “You’ve been off with 
Dumbledore!” 

“It wasn’t that exciting. He just wanted me to help 
him persuade this old teacher to come out of 
retirement. His name’s Horace Slughorn.” 

“Oh,” said Ron, looking disappointed. “We thought — ” 

Hermione flashed a warning look at Ron, and Ron 
changed tack at top speed. 

“ — we thought it’d be something like that.” 

“You did?” said Harry, amused.

“Yeah ... yeah, now Umbridge has left, obviously we 
need a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, 
don’t we? So, er, what’s he like?” 

“He looks a bit like a walrus, and he used to be Head 
of Slytherin,” said Harry. “Something wrong, 
Hermione?” 

She was watching him as though expecting strange 
symptoms to manifest themselves at any moment. 

She rearranged her features hastily in an 
unconvincing smile. 

“No, of course not! So, um, did Slughorn seem like 
he’ll be a good teacher?” 

“Dunno,” said Harry. “He can’t be worse than 
Umbridge, can he?” 

“I know someone who’s worse than Umbridge,” said a 
voice from the doorway. Ron’s younger sister slouched 
into the room, looking irritable. “Hi, Harry.” 

“What’s up with you?” Ron asked. 

“It’s her,” said Ginny, plonking herself down on 
Harry’s bed. “She’s driving me mad.” 

“What’s she done now?” asked Hermione 
sympathetically. 

“It’s the way she talks to me — you’d think I was 
about three!” 

“I know,” said Hermione, dropping her voice. “She’s so 
full of herself.” 

Harry was astonished to hear Hermione talking about 
Mrs. Weasley like this and could not blame Ron for 

Page | 101 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




saying angrily, “Can’t you two lay off her for five 
seconds?” 

“Oh, that’s right, defend her,” snapped Ginny. “We all 
know you can’t get enough of her.” 

This seemed an odd comment to make about Ron’s 
mother. Starting to feel that he was missing 
something, Harry said, “Who are you — ?” 

But his question was answered before he could finish 
it. The bedroom door flew open again, and Harry 
instinctively yanked the bedcovers up to his chin so 
hard that Hermione and Ginny slid off the bed onto 
the floor. 

A young woman was standing in the doorway, a 
woman of such breathtaking beauty that the room 
seemed to have become strangely airless. She was tall 
and willowy with long blonde hair and appeared to 
emanate a faint, silvery glow. To complete this vision 
of perfection, she was carrying a heavily laden 
breakfast tray. 

“ ’Arry,” she said in a throaty voice. “Eet ’as been too 
long!” 

As she swept over the threshold toward him, Mrs. 
Weasley was revealed, bobbing along in her wake, 
looking rather cross. 

“There was no need to bring up the tray, I was just 
about to do it myself!” 

“Eet was no trouble,” said Fleur Delacour, setting the 
tray across Harry’s knees and then swooping to kiss 
him on each cheek: He felt the places where her 
mouth had touched him burn. “I ’ave been longing to 
see ’im. You remember my seester, Gabrielle? She 
Page | 102 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




never stops talking about ’Ariy Potter. She will be 
delighted to see you again.” 



“Oh ... is she here too?” Harry croaked. 

“No, no, silly boy,” said Fleur with a tinkling laugh, “I 
mean next summer, when we — but do you not 
know?” 

Her great blue eyes widened and she looked 
reproachfully at Mrs. Weasley, who said, “We hadn’t 
got around to telling him yet.” 

Fleur turned back to Harry, swinging her silvery sheet 
of hair so that it whipped Mrs. Weasley across the 
face. 

“Bill and I are going to be married!” 

“Oh,” said Harry blankly. He could not help noticing 
how Mrs. Weasley, Hermione, and Ginny were all 
determinedly avoiding one another’s gaze. “Wow. Er 
— congratulations!” 

She swooped down upon him and kissed him again. 

“Bill is very busy at ze moment, working very ’ard, 
and I only work part-time at Gringotts for my 
Eenglish, so he brought me ’ere for a few days to get 
to know ’is family properly. I was so pleased to ’ear 
you would be coming — zere isn’t much to do ’ere, 
unless you like cooking and chickens! Well — enjoy 
your breakfast, ’Arry!” 

With these words she turned gracefully and seemed to 
float out of the room, closing the door quietly behind 
her. 

Mrs. Weasley made a noise that sounded like “tchah!” 

Page | 103 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Mum hates her,” said Ginny quietly. 

“I do not hate her!” said Mrs. Weasley in a cross 
whisper. “I just think they’ve hurried into this 
engagement, that’s all!” 

“They’ve known each other a year,” said Ron, who 
looked oddly groggy and was staring at the closed 
door. 

“Well, that’s not very long! I know why it’s happened, 
of course. It’s all this uncertainty with You-Know-Who 
coming back, people think they might be dead 
tomorrow, so they’re rushing all sorts of decisions 
they’d normally take time over. It was the same last 
time he was powerful, people eloping left, right, and 
center — ” 

“Including you and Dad,” said Ginny slyly. 

“Yes, well, your father and I were made for each other, 
what was the point in waiting?” said Mrs. Weasley. 
“Whereas Bill and Fleur . . . well . . . what have they 
really got in common? He’s a hardworking, down-to- 
earth sort of person, whereas she’s — ” 

“A cow,” said Ginny, nodding. “But Bill’s not that 
down-to-earth. He’s a Curse-Breaker, isn’t he, he 
likes a bit of adventure, a bit of glamour. ... I expect 
that’s why he’s gone for Phlegm.” 

“Stop calling her that, Ginny,” said Mrs. Weasley 
sharply, as Harry and Hermione laughed. “Well, I’d 
better get on. ... Eat your eggs while they’re warm, 
Harry.” 

Looking careworn, she left the room. Ron still seemed 
slightly punch-drunk; he was shaking his head 



Page | 104 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




experimentally like a dog trying to rid its ears of 
water. 

“Don’t you get used to her if she’s staying in the same 
house?” Harry asked. 

“Well, you do,” said Ron, “but if she jumps out at you 
unexpectedly, like then ...” 

“It’s pathetic,” said Hermione furiously, striding away 
from Ron as far as she could go and turning to face 
him with her arms folded once she had reached the 
wall. 

“You don’t really want her around forever?” Ginny 
asked Ron incredulously. When he merely shrugged, 
she said, “Well, Mum’s going to put a stop to it if she 
can, I bet you anything.” 

“How’s she going to manage that?” asked Harry. 

“She keeps trying to get Tonks round for dinner. I 
think she’s hoping Bill will fall for Tonks instead. I 
hope he does, I’d much rather have her in the family.” 

“Yeah, that’ll work,” said Ron sarcastically. “Listen, 
no bloke in his right mind’s going to fancy Tonks 
when Fleur’s around. I mean, Tonks is okay-looking 
when she isn’t doing stupid things to her hair and her 
nose, but — ” 

“She’s a damn sight nicer than Phlegm,” said Ginny 

“And she’s more intelligent, she’s an Auror!” said 
Hermione from the corner. 

“Fleur’s not stupid, she was good enough to enter the 
Triwizard Tournament,” said Harry. 



Page | 105 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Not you as well!” said Hermione bitterly. 



“I suppose you like the way Phlegm says ‘’Arry,’ do 
you?” asked Ginny scornfully. 

“No,” said Harry, wishing he hadn’t spoken, “I was 
just saying, Phlegm — I mean, Fleur — ” 

“I’d much rather have Tonks in the family,” said 
Ginny. “At least she’s a laugh.” 

“She hasn’t been much of a laugh lately,” said Ron. 
“Every time I’ve seen her she’s looked more like 
Moaning Myrtle.” 

“That’s not fair,” snapped Hermione. “She still hasn’t 
got over what happened . . . you know ... I mean, he 
was her cousin!” 

Harry’s heart sank. They had arrived at Sirius. He 
picked up a fork and began shoveling scrambled eggs 
into his mouth, hoping to deflect any invitation to join 
in this part of the conversation. 

“Tonks and Sirius barely knew each other!” said Ron. 
“Sirius was in Azkaban half her life and before that 
their families never met — ” 

“That’s not the point,” said Hermione. “She thinks it 
was her fault he died!” 

“How does she work that one out?” asked Harry, in 
spite of himself. 

“Well, she was fighting Bellatrix Lestrange, wasn’t 
she? I think she feels that if only she had finished her 
off, Bellatrix couldn’t have killed Sirius.” 

“That’s stupid,” said Ron. 

Page | 106 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“It’s survivor’s guilt,” said Hermione. “I know Lupin’s 
tried to talk her round, but she’s still really down. 
She’s actually having trouble with her 
Metamorphosing! ” 

“With her — ?” 

“She can’t change her appearance like she used to,” 
explained Hermione. “I think her powers must have 
been affected by shock, or something.” 

“I didn’t know that could happen,” said Harry. 

“Nor did I,” said Hermione, “but I suppose if you’re 
really depressed ...” 

The door opened again and Mrs. Weasley popped her 
head in. “Ginny,” she whispered, “come downstairs 
and help me with the lunch.” 

“I’m talking to this lot!” said Ginny, outraged. 

“Now!” said Mrs. Weasley, and withdrew. 

“She only wants me there so she doesn’t have to be 
alone with Phlegm!” said Ginny crossly. She swung 
her long red hair around in a very good imitation of 
Fleur and pranced across the room with her arms 
held aloft like a ballerina. 

“You lot had better come down quickly too,” she said 
as she left. 

Harry took advantage of the temporary silence to eat 
more breakfast. Hermione was peering into Fred and 
George’s boxes, though every now and then she cast 
sideways looks at Harry. Ron, who was now helping 
himself to Harry’s toast, was still gazing dreamily at 
the door. 

Page | 107 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“What’s this?” Hermione asked eventually, holding up 
what looked like a small telescope. 

“Dunno,” said Ron, “but if Fred and George’ve left it 
here, it’s probably not ready for the joke shop yet, so 
be careful.” 

“Your mum said the shop’s going well,” said Harry. 
“Said Fred and George have got a real flair for 
business.” 

“That’s an understatement,” said Ron. “They’re raking 
in the Galleons! I can’t wait to see the place, we 
haven’t been to Diagon Alley yet, because Mum says 
Dad’s got to be there for extra security and he’s been 
really busy at work, but it sounds excellent.” 

“And what about Percy?” asked Harry; the third- 
eldest Weasley brother had fallen out with the rest of 
the family. “Is he talking to your mum and dad 
again?” 

“Nope,” said Ron. 

“But he knows your dad was right all along now 
about Voldemort being back — ” 

“Dumbledore says people find it far easier to forgive 
others for being wrong than being right,” said 
Hermione. “I heard him telling your mum, Ron.” 

“Sounds like the sort of mental thing Dumbledore 
would say,” said Ron. 

“He’s going to be giving me private lessons this year,” 
said Harry conversationally. 

Ron choked on his bit of toast, and Hermione gasped. 



Page | 108 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“You kept that quiet!” said Ron. 

“I only just remembered,” said Harry honestly. “He 
told me last night in your broom shed.” 

“Blimey ... private lessons with Dumbledore!” said 
Ron, looking impressed. “I wonder why he’s ... ?” 

His voice tailed away. Harry saw him and Hermione 
exchange looks. Harry laid down his knife and fork, 
his heart beating rather fast considering that all he 
was doing was sitting in bed. Dumbledore had said to 
do it. ... Why not now? He fixed his eyes on his fork, 
which was gleaming in the sunlight streaming into his 
lap, and said, “I don’t know exactly why he’s going to 
be giving me lessons, but I think it must be because 
of the prophecy.” 

Neither Ron nor Hermione spoke. Harry had the 
impression that both had frozen. He continued, still 
speaking to his fork, “You know, the one they were 
trying to steal at the Ministry.” 

“Nobody knows what it said, though,” said Hermione 
quickly. “It got smashed.” 

“Although the Prophet says — ” began Ron, but 
Hermione said, “Shh!” 

“The Prophet’s got it right,” said Harry, looking up at 
them both with a great effort: Hermione seemed 
frightened and Ron amazed. “That glass ball that 
smashed wasn’t the only record of the prophecy. I 
heard the whole thing in Dumbledore ’s office, he was 
the one the prophecy was made to, so he could tell 
me. From what it said,” Harry took a deep breath, “it 
looks like I’m the one who’s got to finish off 
Voldemort. ... At least, it said neither of us could live 
while the other survives.” 

Page | 109 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




The three of them gazed at one another in silence for 
a moment. Then there was a loud bang and Hermione 
vanished behind a puff of black smoke. 

“Hermione!” shouted Harry and Ron; the breakfast 
tray slid to the floor with a crash. 

Hermione emerged, coughing, out of the smoke, 
clutching the telescope and sporting a brilliantly 
purple black eye. 

“I squeezed it and it — it punched me!” she gasped. 

And sure enough, they now saw a tiny fist on a long 
spring protruding from the end of the telescope. 

“Don’t worry,” said Ron, who was plainly trying not to 
laugh, “Mumll fix that, she’s good at healing minor 
injuries — ” 

“Oh well, never mind that now!” said Hermione 
hastily. “Harry, oh, Harry ...” 

She sat down on the edge of his bed again. 

“We wondered, after we got back from the Ministry ... 
Obviously, we didn’t want to say anything to you, but 
from what Lucius Malfoy said about the prophecy, 
how it was about you and Voldemort, well, we 
thought it might be something like this. ... Oh, Harry 
...” She stared at him, then whispered, “Are you 
scared?” 

“Not as much as I was,” said Harry. “When I first 
heard it, I was . . . but now, it seems as though I 
always knew I’d have to face him in the end. ...” 

“When we heard Dumbledore was collecting you in 
person, we thought he might be telling you something 

Page | 110 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




or showing you something to do with the prophecy,” 
said Ron eagerly. “And we were kind of right, weren’t 
we? He wouldn’t be giving you lessons if he thought 
you were a goner, wouldn’t waste his time — he must 
think you’ve got a chance!” 

“That’s true,” said Hermione. “I wonder what he’ll 
teach you, Harry? Really advanced defensive magic, 
probably ... powerful countercurses ... anti-jinxes ...” 

Harry did not really listen. A warmth was spreading 
through him that had nothing to do with the sunlight; 
a tight obstruction in his chest seemed to be 
dissolving. He knew that Ron and Hermione were 
more shocked than they were letting on, but the mere 
fact that they were still there on either side of him, 
speaking bracing words of comfort, not shrinking 
from him as though he were contaminated or 
dangerous, was worth more than he could ever tell 
them. 

"... and evasive enchantments generally,” concluded 
Hermione. “Well, at least you know one lesson you’ll 
be having this year, that’s one more than Ron and 
me. I wonder when our O.W.L. results will come?” 

“Can’t be long now, it’s been a month,” said Ron. 

“Hang on,” said Harry, as another part of last night’s 
conversation came back to him. “I think Dumbledore 
said our O.W.L. results would be arriving today!” 

“Today?” shrieked Hermione. “Today? But why didn’t 
you — oh my God — you should have said — ” 

She leapt to her feet. 

“I’m going to see whether any owls have come. ...” 



Page | 111 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




But when Harry arrived downstairs ten minutes later, 
fully dressed and carrying his empty breakfast tray, it 
was to find Hermione sitting at the kitchen table in 
great agitation, while Mrs. Weasley tried to lessen her 
resemblance to half a panda. 

“It just won’t budge,” Mrs. Weasley was saying 
anxiously, standing over Hermione with her wand in 
her hand and a copy of The Healer’s Helpmate open at 
“Bruises, Cuts, and Abrasions.” “This has always 
worked before, I just can’t understand it.” 

“It’ll be Fred and George’s idea of a funny joke, 
making sure it can’t come off,” said Ginny 

“But it’s got to come off!” squeaked Hermione. “I can’t 
go around looking like this forever!” 

“You won’t, dear, we’ll find an antidote, don’t worry,” 
said Mrs. Weasley soothingly. 

“Bill told me ’ow Fred and George are very amusing!” 
said Fleur, smiling serenely. 

“Yes, I can hardly breathe for laughing,” snapped 
Hermione. 

She jumped up and started walking round and round 
the kitchen, twisting her fingers together. 

“Mrs. Weasley, you’re quite, quite sure no owls have 
arrived this morning?” 

“Yes, dear, I’d have noticed,” said Mrs. Weasley 
patiently. “But it’s barely nine, there’s still plenty of 
time. ...” 

“I know I messed up Ancient Runes,” muttered 
Hermione feverishly, “I definitely made at least one 

Page | 112 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




serious mistranslation. And the Defense Against the 
Dark Arts practical was no good at all. I thought 
Transfiguration went all right at the time, but looking 
back — ” 

“Hermione, will you shut up, you’re not the only one 
who’s nervous!” barked Ron. “And when you’ve got 
your eleven ‘Outstanding’ O.W.L.s ...” 

“Don’t, don’t, don’t!” said Hermione, flapping her 
hands hysterically. “I know I’ve failed everything!” 

“What happens if we fail?” Harry asked the room at 
large, but it was again Hermione who answered. 

“We discuss our options with our Head of House, I 
asked Professor McGonagall at the end of last term.” 

Harry’s stomach squirmed. He wished he had eaten 
less breakfast. 

“At Beauxbatons,” said Fleur complacently, “we ’ad a 
different way of doing things. I think eet was better. 
We sat our examinations after six years of study, not 
five, and then — ” 

Fleur’s words were drowned in a scream. Hermione 
was pointing through the kitchen window. Three 
black specks were clearly visible in the sky, growing 
larger all the time. 

“They’re definitely owls,” said Ron hoarsely, jumping 
up to join Hermione at the window. 

“And there are three of them,” said Harry, hastening 
to her other side. 

“One for each of us,” said Hermione in a terrified 
whisper. “Oh no ... oh no ... oh no ...” 

Page | 113 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




She gripped both Harry and Ron tightly around the 
elbows. 



The owls were flying directly at the Burrow, three 
handsome tawnies, each of which, it became clear as 
they flew lower over the path leading up to the house, 
was carrying a large square envelope. 

“Oh no\” squealed Hermione. 

Mrs. Weasley squeezed past them and opened the 
kitchen window. One, two, three, the owls soared 
through it and landed on the table in a neat line. All 
three of them lifted their right legs. 

Harry moved forward. The letter addressed to him 
was tied to the leg of the owl in the middle. He untied 
it with fumbling fingers. To his left, Ron was trying to 
detach his own results; to his right, Hermione’s 
hands were shaking so much she was making her 
whole owl tremble. 

Nobody in the kitchen spoke. At last, Harry managed 
to detach the envelope. He slit it open quickly and 
unfolded the parchment inside.

Harry read the parchment through several times, his 
breathing becoming easier with each reading. It was 
all right: He had always known that he would fail 
Divination, and he had had no chance of passing 
History of Magic, given that he had collapsed halfway 
through the examination, but he had passed 
everything else! He ran his finger down the grades ... 
he had passed well in Transfiguration and Herbology, 
he had even exceeded expectations at Potions! And 
best of all, he had achieved “Outstanding” at Defense 
Against the Dark Arts! 

He looked around. Hermione had her back to him and 
her head bent, but Ron was looking delighted. 

“Only failed Divination and History of Magic, and who 
cares about them?” he said happily to Harry. “Here — 
swap — ” 

Harry glanced down Ron’s grades: There were no 
“Outstandings” there. ... 

“Knew you’d be top at Defense Against the Dark Arts,” 
said Ron, punching Harry on the shoulder. “We’ve 
done all right, haven’t we?” 

“Well done!” said Mrs. Weasley proudly, ruffling Ron’s 
hair. “Seven O.W.L.s, that’s more than Fred and 
George got together!” 



Page | 115 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Hermione?” said Ginny tentatively, for Hermione still 
hadn’t turned around. “How did you do?” 

“I — not bad,” said Hermione in a small voice. 

“Oh, come off it,” said Ron, striding over to her and 
whipping her results out of her hand. “Yep — nine 
‘Outstandings’ and one ‘Exceeds Expectations’ at 
Defense Against the Dark Arts.” He looked down at 
her, half-amused, half-exasperated. “You’re actually 
disappointed, aren’t you?” 

Hermione shook her head, but Harry laughed. 

“Well, we’re N.E.W.T. students now!” grinned Ron. 
“Mum, are there any more sausages?” 

Harry looked back down at his results. They were as 
good as he could have hoped for. He felt just one tiny 
twinge of regret. ... This was the end of his ambition 
to become an Auror. He had not secured the required 
Potions grade. He had known all along that he 
wouldn’t, but he still felt a sinking in his stomach as 
he looked again at that small black E. 

It was odd, really, seeing that it had been a Death 
Eater in disguise who had first told Harry he would 
make a good Auror, but somehow the idea had taken 
hold of him, and he couldn’t really think of anything 
else he would like to be. Moreover, it had seemed the 
right destiny for him since he had heard the prophecy 
a few weeks ago. ... Neither can live while the other 
survives. ... Wouldn’t he be living up to the prophecy, 
and giving himself the best chance of survival, if he 
joined those highly trained wizards whose job it was 
to find and kill Voldemort?

DRACO’S DETOUR 

Harry remained within the confines of the Burrow’s 
garden over the next few weeks. He spent most of his 
days playing two-a-side Quidditch in the Weasleys’ 
orchard (he and Hermione against Ron and Ginny; 
Hermione was dreadful and Ginny good, so they were 
reasonably well matched) and his evenings eating 
triple helpings of everything Mrs. Weasley put in front 
of him. 

It would have been a happy, peaceful holiday had it 
not been for the stories of disappearances, odd 
accidents, even of deaths now appearing almost daily 
in the Prophet Sometimes Bill and Mr. Weasley 
brought home news before it even reached the paper. 
To Mrs. Weasley’s displeasure, Harry’s sixteenth 
birthday celebrations were marred by grisly tidings 
brought to the party by Remus Lupin, who was 
looking gaunt and grim, his brown hair streaked 
liberally with gray, his clothes more ragged and 
patched than ever. 



Page | 117 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 



“There have been another couple of dementor 
attacks,” he announced, as Mrs. Weasley passed him 
a large slice of birthday cake. “And they’ve found Igor 
Karkaroff’s body in a shack up north. The Dark Mark 
had been set over it — well, frankly, I’m surprised he 
stayed alive for even a year after deserting the Death 
Eaters; Sirius’s brother, Regulus, only managed a few 
days as far as I can remember.” 

“Yes, well,” said Mrs. Weasley, frowning, “perhaps we 
should talk about something diff — ” 

“Did you hear about Florean Fortescue, Remus?” 
asked Bill, who was being plied with wine by Fleur. 
“The man who ran — ” 

“ — the ice-cream place in Diagon Alley?” Harry 
interrupted, with an unpleasant, hollow sensation in 
the pit of his stomach. “He used to give me free ice 
creams. What’s happened to him?” 

“Dragged off, by the look of his place.” 

“Why?” asked Ron, while Mrs. Weasley pointedly 
glared at Bill. 

“Who knows? He must’ve upset them somehow. He 
was a good man, Florean.” 

“Talking of Diagon Alley,” said Mr. Weasley, “looks 
like Ollivander’s gone too.” 

“The wandmaker?” said Ginny, looking startled. 

“That’s the one. Shop’s empty. No sign of a struggle. 
No one knows whether he left voluntarily or was 
kidnapped.” 

“But wands — what’ll people do for wands?”

“They’ll make do with other makers,” said Lupin. “But 
Ollivander was the best, and if the other side have got 
him it’s not so good for us.” 

The day after this rather gloomy birthday tea, their 
letters and booklists arrived from Hogwarts. Harry’s 
included a surprise: He had been made Quidditch 
Captain. 

“That gives you equal status with prefects!” cried 
Hermione happily. “You can use our special bathroom 
now and everything!” 

“Wow, I remember when Charlie wore one of these,” 
said Ron, examining the badge with glee. “Harry, this 
is so cool, you’re my Captain — if you let me back on 
the team, I suppose, ha ha. ...” 

“Well, I don’t suppose we can put off a trip to Diagon 
Alley much longer now you’ve got these,” sighed Mrs. 
Weasley, looking down Ron’s booklist. “We’ll go on 
Saturday as long as your father doesn’t have to go 
into work again. I’m not going there without him.” 

“Mum, d’you honestly think You-Know- Who’s going to 
be hiding behind a bookshelf in Flourish and Blotts?” 
sniggered Ron. 

“Fortescue and Ollivander went on holiday, did they?” 
said Mrs. Weasley, firing up at once. “If you think 
security’s a laughing matter you can stay behind and 
I’ll get your things myself — ” 

“No, I wanna come, I want to see Fred and George’s 
shop!” said Ron hastily. 

“Then you just buck up your ideas, young man, 
before I decide you’re too immature to come with us!” 
said Mrs. Weasley angrily, snatching up her clock, all 

Page | 119 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




nine hands of which were still pointing at “mortal 
peril,” and balancing it on top of a pile of just- 
laundered towels. “And that goes for returning to 
Hogwarts as well!” 

Ron turned to stare incredulously at Harry as his 
mother hoisted the laundry basket and the teetering 
clock into her arms and stormed out of the room. 

“Blimey ... you can’t even make a joke round here 
anymore. ...” 

But Ron was careful not to be flippant about 
Voldemort over the next few days. Saturday dawned 
without any more outbursts from Mrs. Weasley, 
though she seemed very tense at breakfast. Bill, who 
would be staying at home with Fleur (much to 
Hermione and Ginny’s pleasure), passed a full money 
bag across the table to Harry. 

“Where’s mine?” demanded Ron at once, his eyes 
wide. 

“That’s already Harry’s, idiot,” said Bill. “I got it out of 
your vault for you, Harry, because it’s taking about 
five hours for the public to get to their gold at the 
moment, the goblins have tightened security so 
much. Two days ago Arkie Philpott had a Probity 
Probe stuck up his ... Well, trust me, this way’s 
easier.” 

“Thanks, Bill,” said Harry, pocketing his gold. 

“ ’E is always so thoughtful,” purred Fleur adoringly, 
stroking Bill’s nose. Ginny mimed vomiting into her 
cereal behind Fleur. Harry choked over his 
cornflakes, and Ron thumped him on the back.

It was an overcast, murky day. One of the special 
Ministry of Magic cars, in which Harry had ridden 
once before, was awaiting them in the front yard 
when they emerged from the house, pulling on their 
cloaks. 

“It’s good Dad can get us these again,” said Ron 
appreciatively, stretching luxuriously as the car 
moved smoothly away from the Burrow, Bill and Fleur 
waving from the kitchen window. He, Harry, 

Hermione, and Ginny were all sitting in roomy 
comfort in the wide backseat. 

“Don’t get used to it, it’s only because of Harry,” said 
Mr. Weasley over his shoulder. He and Mrs. Weasley 
were in front with the Ministry driver; the front 
passenger seat had obligingly stretched into what 
resembled a two-seater sofa. “He’s been given top- 
grade security status. And we’ll be joining up with 
additional security at the Leaky Cauldron too.” 

Harry said nothing; he did not much fancy doing his 
shopping while surrounded by a battalion of Aurors. 
He had stowed his Invisibility Cloak in his backpack 
and felt that, if that was good enough for 
Dumbledore, it ought to be good enough for the 
Ministry, though now he came to think of it, he was 
not sure the Ministry knew about his cloak. 

“Here you are, then,” said the driver, a surprisingly 
short while later, speaking for the first time as he 
slowed in Charing Cross Road and stopped outside 
the Leaky Cauldron. “I’m to wait for you, any idea 
how long you 11 be?” 

“A couple of hours, I expect,” said Mr. Weasley. “Ah, 
good, he’s here!” 



Page | 121 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Harry imitated Mr. Weasley and peered through the 
window; his heart leapt. There were no Aurors waiting 
outside the inn, but instead the gigantic, black- 
bearded form of Rubeus Hagrid, the Hogwarts 
gamekeeper, wearing a long beaverskin coat, beaming 
at the sight of Harry’s face and oblivious to the 
startled stares of passing Muggles. 

“Harry!” he boomed, sweeping Harry into a bone- 
crushing hug the moment Harry had stepped out of 
the car. “Buckbeak — Witherwings, I mean — yeh 
should see him, Harry, he’s so happy ter be back in 
the open air — ” 

“Glad he’s pleased,” said Harry, grinning as he 
massaged his ribs. “We didn’t know ‘security’ meant 
you!” 

“I know, jus’ like old times, innit? See, the Ministry 
wanted ter send a bunch o’ Aurors, but Dumbledore 
said I’d do,” said Hagrid proudly, throwing out his 
chest and tucking his thumbs into his pockets. “Let’s 
get goin’ then — after yeh, Molly, Arthur — ” 

The Leaky Cauldron was, for the first time in Harry’s 
memory, completely empty. Only Tom the landlord, 
wizened and toothless, remained of the old crowd. He 
looked up hopefully as they entered, but before he 
could speak, Hagrid said importantly, “Jus’ passin’ 
through today, Tom, sure yeh understand, Hogwarts 
business, yeh know.” 

Tom nodded gloomily and returned to wiping glasses; 
Harry, Hermione, Hagrid, and the Weasleys walked 
through the bar and out into the chilly little courtyard 
at the back where the dustbins stood. Hagrid raised 
his pink umbrella and rapped a certain brick in the 
wall, which opened at once to form an archway onto a 



Page | 122 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




winding cobbled street. They stepped through the 
entrance and paused, looking around. 

Diagon Alley had changed. The colorful, glittering 
window displays of spellbooks, potion ingredients, 
and cauldrons were lost to view, hidden behind the 
large Ministry of Magic posters that had been pasted 
over them. Most of these somber purple posters 
carried blown-up versions of the security advice on 
the Ministry pamphlets that had been sent out over 
the summer, but others bore moving black-and-white 
photographs of Death Eaters known to be on the 
loose. Bellatrix Lestrange was sneering from the front 
of the nearest apothecary. A few windows were 
boarded up, including those of Florean Fortescue’s Ice 
Cream Parlor. On the other hand, a number of 
shabby-looking stalls had sprung up along the street. 
The nearest one, which had been erected outside 
Flourish and Blotts, under a striped, stained awning, 
had a cardboard sign pinned to its front: 

AMULETS 

Effective Against Werewolves, Dementors, and Inferi 

A seedy-looking little wizard was rattling armfuls of 
silver symbols on chains at passersby. 

“One for your little girl, madam?” he called at Mrs. 
Weasley as they passed, leering at Ginny. “Protect her 
pretty neck?” 

“If I were on duty ...” said Mr. Weasley, glaring angrily 
at the amulet seller. 

“Yes, but don’t go arresting anyone now, dear, we’re 
in a hurry,” said Mrs. Weasley, nervously consulting a 
list. “I think we’d better do Madam Malkin’s first, 
Hermione wants new dress robes, and Ron’s showing 

Page | 123 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




much too much ankle in his school robes, and you 
must need new ones too, Harry, you’ve grown so 
much — come on, everyone — ” 

“Molly, it doesn’t make sense for all of us to go to 
Madam Malkin’s,” said Mr. Weasley. “Why don’t those 
three go with Hagrid, and we can go to Flourish and 
Blotts and get everyone’s schoolbooks?” 

“I don’t know,” said Mrs. Weasley anxiously, clearly 
torn between a desire to finish the shopping quickly 
and the wish to stick together in a pack. “Hagrid, do 
you think — ?” 

“Don’ fret, they’ll be fine with me, Molly,” said Hagrid 
soothingly, waving an airy hand the size of a dustbin 
lid. Mrs. Weasley did not look entirely convinced, but 
allowed the separation, scurrying off toward Flourish 
and Blotts with her husband and Ginny while Harry, 
Ron, Hermione, and Hagrid set off for Madam 
Malkin’s. 

Harry noticed that many of the people who passed 
them had the same harried, anxious look as Mrs. 
Weasley, and that nobody was stopping to talk 
anymore; the shoppers stayed together in their own 
tightly knit groups, moving intently about their 
business. Nobody seemed to be shopping alone. 

“Migh’ be a bit of a squeeze in there with all of us,” 
said Hagrid, stopping outside Madam Malkin’s and 
bending down to peer through the window. “I’ll stand 
guard outside, all right?” 

So Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered the little shop 
together. It appeared, at first glance, to be empty, but 
no sooner had the door swung shut behind them than 
they heard a familiar voice issuing from behind a rack 
of dress robes in spangled green and blue. 

Page | 124 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




"... not a child, in case you haven’t noticed, Mother. I 
am perfectly capable of doing my shopping alone.” 

There was a clucking noise and a voice Harry 
recognized as that of Madam Malkin, the owner, said, 
“Now, dear, your mother’s quite right, none of us is 
supposed to go wandering around on our own 
anymore, it’s nothing to do with being a child — ” 

“Watch where you’re sticking that pin, will you!” 

A teenage boy with a pale, pointed face and white- 
blond hair appeared from behind the rack, wearing a 
handsome set of dark green robes that glittered with 
pins around the hem and the edges of the sleeves. He 
strode to the mirror and examined himself; it was a 
few moments before he noticed Harry, Ron, and 
Hermione reflected over his shoulder. His light gray 
eyes narrowed. 

“If you’re wondering what the smell is, Mother, a 
Mudblood just walked in,” said Draco Malfoy. 

“I don’t think there’s any need for language like that!” 
said Madam Malkin, scurrying out from behind the 
clothes rack holding a tape measure and a wand. 
“And I don’t want wands drawn in my shop either!” 
she added hastily, for a glance toward the door had 
shown her Harry and Ron both standing there with 
their wands out and pointing at Malfoy. Hermione, 
who was standing slightly behind them, whispered, 
“No, don’t, honestly, it’s not worth it. ...” 

“Yeah, like you’d dare do magic out of school,” 
sneered Malfoy. “Who blacked your eye, Granger? I 
want to send them flowers.” 



Page | 125 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“That’s quite enough!” said Madam Malkin sharply, 
looking over her shoulder for support. “Madam — 
please — ” 

Narcissa Malfoy strolled out from behind the clothes 
rack. 

“Put those away,” she said coldly to Harry and Ron. 

“If you attack my son again, I shall ensure that it is 
the last thing you ever do.” 

“Really?” said Harry, taking a step forward and gazing 
into the smoothly arrogant face that, for all its pallor, 
still resembled her sister’s. He was as tall as she was 
now. “Going to get a few Death Eater pals to do us in, 
are you?” 

Madam Malkin squealed and clutched at her heart. 

“Really, you shouldn’t accuse — dangerous thing to 
say — wands away, please!” 

But Harry did not lower his wand. Narcissa Malfoy 
smiled unpleasantly. 

“I see that being Dumbledore’s favorite has given you 
a false sense of security, Harry Potter. But 
Dumbledore won’t always be there to protect you.” 

Harry looked mockingly all around the shop. “Wow ... 
look at that ... he’s not here now! So why not have a 
go? They might be able to find you a double cell in 
Azkaban with your loser of a husband!” 

Malfoy made an angry movement toward Harry, but 
stumbled over his overlong robe. Ron laughed loudly. 

“Don’t you dare talk to my mother like that, Potter!” 
Malfoy snarled. 

Page | 126 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“It’s all right, Draco,” said Narcissa, restraining him 
with her thin white fingers upon his shoulder. “I 
expect Potter will be reunited with dear Sirius before I 
am reunited with Lucius.” 

Harry raised his wand higher. 

“Harry, no!” moaned Hermione, grabbing his arm and 
attempting to push it down by his side. “Think. ... 

You mustn’t. ... You’ll be in such trouble. ...” 

Madam Malkin dithered for a moment on the spot, 
then seemed to decide to act as though nothing was 
happening in the hope that it wouldn’t. She bent 
toward Malfoy, who was still glaring at Harry. 

“I think this left sleeve could come up a little bit more, 
dear, let me just — ” 

“Ouch!” bellowed Malfoy, slapping her hand away. 
“Watch where you’re putting your pins, woman! 
Mother — I don’t think I want these anymore — ” 

He pulled the robes over his head and threw them 
onto the floor at Madam Malkin’s feet. 

“You’re right, Draco,” said Narcissa, with a 
contemptuous glance at Hermione, “now I know the 
kind of scum that shops here. ... We’ll do better at 
Twilfitt and Tatting’s.” 

And with that, the pair of them strode out of the 
shop, Malfoy taking care to bang as hard as he could 
into Ron on the way out. 

“Well, reallyl” said Madam Malkin, snatching up the 
fallen robes and moving the tip of her wand over them 
like a vacuum cleaner, so that it removed all the dust. 



Page | 127 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




She was distracted all through the fitting of Ron’s and 
Harry’s new robes, tried to sell Hermione wizard’s 
dress robes instead of witch’s, and when she finally 
bowed them out of the shop it was with an air of 
being glad to see the back of them. 

“Got ev’rything?” asked Hagrid brightly when they 
reappeared at his side. 

“Just about,” said Harry. “Did you see the Malfoys?” 

“Yeah,” said Hagrid, unconcerned. “Bu’ they wouldn’ 
dare make trouble in the middle o’ Diagon Alley, 
Harry. Don’ worry abou’ them.” 

Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchanged looks, but 
before they could disabuse Hagrid of this comfortable 
notion, Mr. and Mrs. Weasley and Ginny appeared, all 
clutching heavy packages of books. 

“Everyone all right?” said Mrs. Weasley. “Got your 
robes? Right then, we can pop in at the Apothecary 
and Eeylops on the way to Fred and George’s — stick 
close, now. ...” 

Neither Harry nor Ron bought any ingredients at the 
Apothecary, seeing that they were no longer studying 
Potions, but both bought large boxes of owl nuts for 
Hedwig and Pigwidgeon at Eeylops Owl Emporium. 
Then, with Mrs. Weasley checking her watch every 
minute or so, they headed farther along the street in 
search of Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes, the joke shop 
run by Fred and George. 

“We really haven’t got too long,” Mrs. Weasley said. 

“So we’ll just have a quick look around and then back 
to the car. We must be close, that’s number ninety- 
two ... ninety-four ...” 



Page | 128 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Whoa,” said Ron, stopping in his tracks. 

Set against the dull, poster-muffled shop fronts 
around them, Fred and George’s windows hit the eye 
like a firework display. Casual passersby were looking 
back over their shoulders at the windows, and a few 
rather stunned-looking people had actually come to a 
halt, transfixed. The left-hand window was dazzlingly 
full of an assortment of goods that revolved, popped, 
flashed, bounced, and shrieked; Harry’s eyes began to 
water just looking at it. The right-hand window was 
covered with a gigantic poster, purple like those of the 
Ministry, but emblazoned with flashing yellow letters: 

WHY ARE YOU WORRYING ABOUT 

YOU-KNOW-WHO? 

YOU SHOULD BE WORRYING ABOUT 
U-NO-POO— 

THE CONSTIPATION SENSATION 
THAT’S GRIPPING THE NATION! 

Harry started to laugh. He heard a weak sort of moan 
beside him and looked around to see Mrs. Weasley 
gazing, dumbfounded, at the poster. Her lips moved 
silently, mouthing the name “U-No-Poo.” 

“They’ll be murdered in their beds!” she whispered. 

“No they won’t!” said Ron, who, like Harry, was 
laughing. “This is brilliant!” 

And he and Harry led the way into the shop. It was 
packed with customers; Harry could not get near the 

Page | 129 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




shelves. He stared around, looking up at the boxes 
piled to the ceiling: Here were the Skiving Snackboxes 
that the twins had perfected during their last, 
unfinished year at Hogwarts; Harry noticed that the 
Nosebleed Nougat was most popular, with only one 
battered box left on the shelf. There were bins full of 
trick wands, the cheapest merely turning into rubber 
chickens or pairs of briefs when waved, the most 
expensive beating the unwary user around the head 
and neck, and boxes of quills, which came in Self- 
Inking, Spell-Checking, and Smart-Answer varieties. 

A space cleared in the crowd, and Harry pushed his 
way toward the counter, where a gaggle of delighted 
ten-year-olds was watching a tiny little wooden man 
slowly ascending the steps to a real set of gallows, 
both perched on a box that read: REUSABLE 
HANGMAN — SPELL IT OR HE’LL SWING! 

“ ‘Patented Daydream Charms . . . ’ ” 

Hermione had managed to squeeze through to a large 
display near the counter and was reading the 
information on the back of a box bearing a highly 
colored picture of a handsome youth and a swooning 
girl who were standing on the deck of a pirate ship. 

“ ‘One simple incantation and you will enter a top- 
quality, highly realistic, thirty-minute daydream, easy 
to fit into the average school lesson and virtually 
undetectable (side effects include vacant expression 
and minor drooling). Not for sale to under-sixteens.’ 
You know,” said Hermione, looking up at Harry, “that 
really is extraordinary magic!” 

“For that, Hermione,” said a voice behind them, “you 
can have one for free.” 



Page | 130 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




A beaming Fred stood before them, wearing a set of 
magenta robes that clashed magnificently with his 
flaming hair. 

“How are you, Harry?” They shook hands. “And 
what’s happened to your eye, Hermione?” 

“Your punching telescope,” she said ruefully. 

“Oh blimey, I forgot about those,” said Fred. “Here — ” 

He pulled a tub out of his pocket and handed it to 
her; she unscrewed it gingerly to reveal a thick yellow 
paste. 

“Just dab it on, that bruise’ll be gone within the 
hour,” said Fred. “We had to find a decent bruise 
remover. We’re testing most of our products on 
ourselves.” 

Hermione looked nervous. “It is safe, isn’t it?” she 
asked. 

“ ’Course it is,” said Fred bracingly. “Come on, Harry, 
I’ll give you a tour.” 

Harry left Hermione dabbing her black eye with paste 
and followed Fred toward the back of the shop, where 
he saw a stand of card and rope tricks. 

“Muggle magic tricks!” said Fred happily, pointing 
them out. “For freaks like Dad, you know, who love 
Muggle stuff. It’s not a big earner, but we do fairly 
steady business, they’re great novelties. ... Oh, here’s 
George. ...” 

Fred’s twin shook Harry’s hand energetically. 



Page | 131 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Giving him the tour? Come through the back, Harry, 
that’s where we’re making the real money — pocket 
anything, you, and you’ll pay in more than GalleonsV’ 
he added warningly to a small boy who hastily 
whipped his hand out of the tub labeled EDIBLE 
DARK MARKS — THEY’LL MAKE ANYONE SICK! 

George pushed back a curtain beside the Muggle 
tricks and Harry saw a darker, less crowded room. 
The packaging on the products lining these shelves 
was more subdued. 

“We’ve just developed this more serious line,” said 
Fred. “Funny how it happened ...” 

“You wouldn’t believe how many people, even people 
who work at the Ministry, can’t do a decent Shield 
Charm,” said George. “ ’Course, they didn’t have you 
teaching them, Harry.” 

“That’s right. ... Well, we thought Shield Hats were a 
bit of a laugh, you know, challenge your mate to jinx 
you while wearing it and watch his face when the jinx 
just bounces off. But the Ministry bought five 
hundred for all its support staff! And we’re still 
getting massive orders!” 

“So we’ve expanded into a range of Shield Cloaks, 
Shield Gloves ...” 

"... I mean, they wouldn’t help much against the 
Unforgivable Curses, but for minor to moderate hexes 
or jinxes ...” 

“And then we thought we’d get into the whole area of 
Defense Against the Dark Arts, because it’s such a 
money spinner,” continued George enthusiastically. 
“This is cool. Look, Instant Darkness Powder, we’re 



Page | 132 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




importing it from Peru. Handy if you want to make a 
quick escape.” 

“And our Decoy Detonators are just walking off the 
shelves, look,” said Fred, pointing at a number of 
weird-looking black horn-type objects that were 
indeed attempting to scurry out of sight. “You just 
drop one surreptitiously and it’ll run off and make a 
nice loud noise out of sight, giving you a diversion if 
you need one. 

“Handy,” said Harry, impressed. 

“Here,” said George, catching a couple and throwing 
them to Harry. 

A young witch with short blonde hair poked her head 
around the curtain; Harry saw that she too was 
wearing magenta staff robes. 

“There’s a customer out here looking for a joke 
cauldron, Mr. Weasley and Mr. Weasley,” she said. 

Harry found it very odd to hear Fred and George 
called “Mr. Weasley,” but they took it in their stride. 

“Right you are, Verity, I’m coming,” said George 
promptly. “Harry, you help yourself to anything you 
want, all right? No charge.” 

“I can’t do that!” said Harry, who had already pulled 
out his money bag to pay for the Decoy Detonators. 

“You don’t pay here,” said Fred firmly, waving away 
Harry’s gold. 

“But — ” 



Page | 133 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“You gave us our start-up loan, we haven’t forgotten,” 
said George sternly. “Take whatever you like, and just 
remember to tell people where you got it, if they ask.” 

George swept off through the curtain to help with the 
customers, and Fred led Harry back into the main 
part of the shop to find Hermione and Ginny still 
poring over the Patented Daydream Charms. 

“Haven’t you girls found our special WonderWitch 
products yet?” asked Fred. “Follow me, ladies. ...” 

Near the window was an array of violently pink 
products around which a cluster of excited girls was 
giggling enthusiastically. Hermione and Ginny both 
hung back, looking wary. 

“There you go,” said Fred proudly. “Best range of love 
potions you’ll find anywhere.” 

Ginny raised an eyebrow skeptically. “Do they work?” 
she asked. 

“Certainly they work, for up to twenty-four hours at a 
time depending on the weight of the boy in question 



“ — and the attractiveness of the girl,” said George, 
reappearing suddenly at their side. “But we’re not 
selling them to our sister,” he added, becoming 
suddenly stern, “not when she’s already got about five 
boys on the go from what we’ve — ” 

“Whatever you’ve heard from Ron is a big fat lie,” said 
Ginny calmly, leaning forward to take a small pink 
pot off the shelf. “What’s this?” 

“Guaranteed ten-second pimple vanisher,” said Fred. 
“Excellent on everything from boils to blackheads, but 

Page | 134 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




don’t change the subject. Are you or are you not 
currently going out with a boy called Dean Thomas?” 

“Yes, I am,” said Ginny. “And last time I looked, he 
was definitely one boy, not five. What are those?” 

She was pointing at a number of round balls of fluff 
in shades of pink and purple, all rolling around the 
bottom of a cage and emitting high-pitched squeaks. 

“Pygmy Puffs,” said George. “Miniature puffskeins, we 
can’t breed them fast enough. So what about Michael 
Corner?” 

“I dumped him, he was a bad loser,” said Ginny, 
putting a finger through the bars of the cage and 
watching the Pygmy Puffs crowd around it. “They’re 
really cute!” 

“They’re fairly cuddly, yes,” conceded Fred. “But 
you’re moving through boyfriends a bit fast, aren’t 
you?” 

Ginny turned to look at him, her hands on her hips. 
There was such a Mrs. Weasley-ish glare on her face 
that Harry was surprised Fred didn’t recoil. 

“It’s none of your business. And I’ll thank you,” she 
added angrily to Ron, who had just appeared at 
George’s elbow, laden with merchandise, “not to tell 
tales about me to these two!” 

“That’s three Galleons, nine Sickles, and a Knut,” said 
Fred, examining the many boxes in Ron’s arms. 
“Cough up.” 

“I’m your brother!” 



Page | 135 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“And that’s our stuff you’re nicking. Three Galleons, 
nine Sickles. I’ll knock off the Knut.” 

“But I haven’t got three Galleons, nine Sickles!” 

“You’d better put it back then, and mind you put it on 
the right shelves.” 

Ron dropped several boxes, swore, and made a rude 
hand gesture at Fred that was unfortunately spotted 
by Mrs. Weasley, who had chosen that moment to 
appear. 

“If I see you do that again I’ll jinx your fingers 
together,” she said sharply. 

“Mum, can I have a Pygmy Puff?” said Ginny at once. 
“A what?” said Mrs. Weasley warily. 

“Look, they’re so sweet. ...” 

Mrs. Weasley moved aside to look at the Pygmy Puffs, 
and Harry, Ron, and Hermione momentarily had an 
unimpeded view out of the window. Draco Malfoy was 
hurrying up the street alone. As he passed Weasleys’ 
Wizard Wheezes, he glanced over his shoulder. 
Seconds later, he moved beyond the scope of the 
window and they lost sight of him. 

“Wonder where his mummy is?” said Harry, frowning. 

“Given her the slip by the looks of it,” said Ron. 

“Why, though?” said Hermione. 

Harry said nothing; he was thinking too hard. 

Narcissa Malfoy would not have let her precious son 
out of her sight willingly; Malfoy must have made a 

Page | 136 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




real effort to free himself from her clutches. Harry, 
knowing and loathing Malfoy, was sure the reason 
could not be innocent. 

He glanced around. Mrs. Weasley and Ginny were 
bending over the Pygmy Puffs. Mr. Weasley was 
delightedly examining a pack of Muggle marked 
playing cards. Fred and George were both helping 
customers. On the other side of the glass, Hagrid was 
standing with his back to them, looking up and down 
the street. 

“Get under here, quick,” said Harry, pulling his 
Invisibility Cloak out of his bag. 

“Oh — I don’t know, Harry,” said Hermione, looking 
uncertainly toward Mrs. Weasley. 

“Come on\” said Ron. 

She hesitated for a second longer, then ducked under 
the cloak with Harry and Ron. Nobody noticed them 
vanish; they were all too interested in Fred and 
George’s products. Harry, Ron, and Hermione 
squeezed their way out of the door as quickly as they 
could, but by the time they gained the street, Malfoy 
had disappeared just as successfully as they had. 

“He was going in that direction,” murmured Harry as 
quietly as possible, so that the humming Hagrid 
would not hear them. “C’mon.” 

They scurried along, peering left and right, through 
shop windows and doors, until Hermione pointed 
ahead. 

“That’s him, isn’t it?” she whispered. “Turning left?” 
“Big surprise,” whispered Ron.

For Malfoy had glanced around, then slid into 
Knockturn Alley and out of sight. 



“Quick, or we’ll lose him,” said Harry, speeding up. 

“Our feet’ll be seen!” said Hermione anxiously, as the 
cloak flapped a little around their ankles; it was much 
more difficult hiding all three of them under the cloak 
nowadays. 

“It doesn’t matter,” said Harry impatiently. “Just 
hurry!” 

But Knockturn Alley, the side street devoted to the 
Dark Arts, looked completely deserted. They peered 
into windows as they passed, but none of the shops 
seemed to have any customers at all. Harry supposed 
it was a bit of a giveaway in these dangerous and 
suspicious times to buy Dark artifacts — or at least, 
to be seen buying them. 

Hermione gave his arm a hard pinch. 

“Ouch!” 

“Shh! Look! He’s in there!” she breathed in Harry’s 
ear. 

They had drawn level with the only shop in 
Knockturn Alley that Harry had ever visited, Borgin 
and Burkes, which sold a wide variety of sinister 
objects. There in the midst of the cases full of skulls 
and old bottles stood Draco Malfoy with his back to 
them, just visible beyond the very same large black 
cabinet in which Harry had once hidden to avoid 
Malfoy and his father. Judging by the movements of 
Malfoy’s hands, he was talking animatedly. The 
proprietor of the shop, Mr. Borgin, an oily-haired, 



Page | 138 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




stooping man, stood facing Malfoy. He was wearing a 
curious expression of mingled resentment and fear. 



“If only we could hear what they’re saying!” said 
Hermione. 

“We can!” said Ron excitedly. “Hang on — damn — ” 

He dropped a couple more of the boxes he was still 
clutching as he fumbled with the largest. 

“Extendable Ears, look!” 

“Fantastic!” said Hermione, as Ron unraveled the 
long, fleshcolored strings and began to feed them 
toward the bottom of the door. “Oh, I hope the door 
isn’t Imperturbable — ” 

“No!” said Ron gleefully. “Listen!” 

They put their heads together and listened intently to 
the ends of the strings, through which Malfoy’s voice 
could be heard loud and clear, as though a radio had 
been turned on. 

"... you know how to fix it?” 

“Possibly,” said Borgin, in a tone that suggested he 
was unwilling to commit himself. “I’ll need to see it, 
though. Why don’t you bring it into the shop?” 

“I can’t,” said Malfoy. “It’s got to stay put. I just need 
you to tell me how to do it.” 

Harry saw Borgin lick his lips nervously. 

“Well, without seeing it, I must say it will be a very 
difficult job, perhaps impossible. I couldn’t guarantee 
anything.” 

Page | 139 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“No?” said Malfoy, and Harry knew, just by his tone, 
that Malfoy was sneering. “Perhaps this will make you 
more confident.” 

He moved toward Borgin and was blocked from view 
by the cabinet. Harry, Ron, and Hermione shuffled 
sideways to try and keep him in sight, but all they 
could see was Borgin, looking very frightened. 

“Tell anyone,” said Malfoy, “and there will be 
retribution. You know Fenrir Greyback? He’s a family 
friend. He’ll be dropping in from time to time to make 
sure you’re giving the problem your full attention.” 

“There will be no need for — ” 

“I’ll decide that,” said Malfoy. “Well, I’d better be off. 
And don’t forget to keep that one safe, I’ll need it.” 

“Perhaps you’d like to take it now?” 

“No, of course I wouldn’t, you stupid little man, how 
would I look carrying that down the street? Just don’t 
sell it.” 

“Of course not ... sir.” 

Borgin made a bow as deep as the one Harry had 
once seen him give Lucius Malfoy. 

“Not a word to anyone, Borgin, and that includes my 
mother, understand?” 

“Naturally, naturally,” murmured Borgin, bowing 
again. 

Next moment, the bell over the door tinkled loudly as 
Malfoy stalked out of the shop looking very pleased 
with himself. He passed so close to Harry, Ron, and 

Page | 140 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Hermione that they felt the cloak flutter around their 
knees again. Inside the shop, Borgin remained frozen; 
his unctuous smile had vanished; he looked worried. 

“What was that about?” whispered Ron, reeling in the 
Extendable Ears. 

“Dunno,” said Harry, thinking hard. “He wants 
something mended . . . and he wants to reserve 
something in there. ... Could you see what he pointed 
at when he said ‘that one’?” 

“No, he was behind that cabinet — ” 

“You two stay here,” whispered Hermione. 

“What are you — ?” 

But Hermione had already ducked out from under the 
cloak. She checked her hair in the reflection in the 
glass, then marched into the shop, setting the bell 
tinkling again. Ron hastily fed the Extendable Ears 
back under the door and passed one of the strings to 
Harry. 

“Hello, horrible morning, isn’t it?” Hermione said 
brightly to Borgin, who did not answer, but cast her a 
suspicious look. Humming cheerily, Hermione strolled 
through the jumble of objects on display. 

“Is this necklace for sale?” she asked, pausing beside 
a glass-fronted case. 

“If you’ve got one and a half thousand Galleons,” said 
Mr. Borgin coldly. 

“Oh — er — no, I haven’t got quite that much,” said 
Hermione, walking on. “And ... what about this lovely 
— um — skull?” 

Page | 141 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Sixteen Galleons.” 



“So it’s for sale, then? It isn’t being ... kept for 
anyone?” 

Mr. Borgin squinted at her. Harry had the nasty 
feeling he knew exactly what Hermione was up to. 
Apparently Hermione felt she had been rumbled too 
because she suddenly threw caution to the winds. 

“The thing is, that — er — boy who was in here just 
now, Draco Malfoy, well, he’s a friend of mine, and I 
want to get him a birthday present, but if he’s already 
reserved anything, I obviously don’t want to get him 
the same thing, so ... um ...” 

It was a pretty lame story in Harry’s opinion, and 
apparently Borgin thought so too. 

“Out,” he said sharply. “Get out!” 

Hermione did not wait to be asked twice, but hurried 
to the door with Borgin at her heels. As the bell 
tinkled again, Borgin slammed the door behind her 
and put up the closed sign. 

“Ah well,” said Ron, throwing the cloak back over 
Hermione. “Worth a try, but you were a bit obvious — 



“Well, next time you can show me how it’s done, 
Master of Mystery!” she snapped. 

Ron and Hermione bickered all the way back to 
Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes, where they were forced to 
stop so that they could dodge undetected around a 
very anxious-looking Mrs. Weasley and Hagrid, who 
had clearly noticed their absence. Once in the shop, 
Harry whipped off the Invisibility Cloak, hid it in his 
Page | 142 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




bag, and joined in with the other two when they 
insisted, in answer to Mrs. Weasley’s accusations, 
that they had been in the back room all along, and 
that she could not have looked properly.

THE SLUG CLUB 

Harry spent a lot of the last week of the holidays 
pondering the meaning of Malfoy’s behavior in 
Knockturn Alley. What disturbed him most was the 
satisfied look on Malfoy’s face as he had left the shop. 
Nothing that made Malfoy look that happy could be 
good news. To his slight annoyance, however, neither 
Ron nor Hermione seemed quite as curious about 
Malfoy’s activities as he was; or at least, they seemed 
to get bored of discussing it after a few days. 

“Yes, I’ve already agreed it was fishy, Harry,” said 
Hermione a little impatiently. She was sitting on the 
windowsill in Fred and George’s room with her feet up 
on one of the cardboard boxes and had only 
grudgingly looked up from her new copy of Advanced 
Rune Translation. “But haven’t we agreed there could 
be a lot of explanations?” 

“Maybe he’s broken his Hand of Glory,” said Ron 
vaguely, as he attempted to straighten his 



Page | 144 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 



broomstick’s bent tail twigs. “Remember that 
shriveled-up arm Malfoy had?” 

“But what about when he said, ‘Don’t forget to keep 
that one safe’?” asked Harry for the umpteenth time. 
“That sounded to me like Borgin’s got another one of 
the broken objects, and Malfoy wants both.” 

“You reckon?” said Ron, now trying to scrape some 
dirt off his broom handle. 

“Yeah, I do,” said Harry. When neither Ron nor 
Hermione answered, he said, “Malfoy’s father’s in 
Azkaban. Don’t you think Malfoy’d like revenge?” 

Ron looked up, blinking. 

“Malfoy, revenge? What can he do about it?” 

“That’s my point, I don’t know!” said Harry, 
frustrated. “But he’s up to something and I think we 
should take it seriously. His father’s a Death Eater 
and — ” 

Harry broke off, his eyes fixed on the window behind 
Hermione, his mouth open. A startling thought had 
just occurred to him. 

“Harry?” said Hermione in an anxious voice. “What’s 
wrong?” 

“Your scar’s not hurting again, is it?” asked Ron 
nervously. 

“He’s a Death Eater,” said Harry slowly. “He’s 
replaced his father as a Death Eater!” 



Page | 145 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




There was a silence; then Ron erupted in laughter. 
“Malfoy? He’s sixteen, Harry! You think You-Know- 
Who would let Malfoy join?” 

“It seems very unlikely, Harry,” said Hermione in a 
repressive sort of voice. “What makes you think — ?” 

“In Madam Malkin’s. She didn’t touch him, but he 
yelled and jerked his arm away from her when she 
went to roll up his sleeve. It was his left arm. He’s 
been branded with the Dark Mark.” 

Ron and Hermione looked at each other. 

“Well ...” said Ron, sounding thoroughly unconvinced. 

“I think he just wanted to get out of there, Harry,” 
said Hermione. 

“He showed Borgin something we couldn’t see,” Harry 
pressed on stubbornly. “Something that seriously 
scared Borgin. It was the Mark, I know it — he was 
showing Borgin who he was dealing with, you saw 
how seriously Borgin took him!” 

Ron and Hermione exchanged another look. 

“I’m not sure, Harry. ...” 

“Yeah, I still don’t reckon You-Know-Who would let 
Malfoy join. ...” 

Annoyed, but absolutely convinced he was right, 

Harry snatched up a pile of filthy Quidditch robes and 
left the room; Mrs. Weasley had been urging them for 
days not to leave their washing and packing until the 
last moment. On the landing he bumped into Ginny, 
who was returning to her room carrying a pile of 
freshly laundered clothes. 

Page | 146 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“I wouldn’t go in the kitchen just now,” she warned 
him. “There’s a lot of Phlegm around.” 



“I’ll be careful not to slip in it.” Harry smiled. 

Sure enough, when he entered the kitchen it was to 
find Fleur sitting at the kitchen table, in full flow 
about plans for her wedding to Bill, while Mrs. 
Weasley kept watch over a pile of self-peeling sprouts, 
looking bad-tempered. 

“... Bill and I ’ave almost decided on only two 
bridesmaids, Ginny and Gabrielle will look very sweet 
togezzer. I am theenking of dressing zem in pale gold 
— pink would of course be ’orrible with Ginny’s ’air — 



“Ah, Harry!” said Mrs. Weasley loudly, cutting across 
Fleur’s monologue. “Good, I wanted to explain about 
the security arrangements for the journey to 
Hogwarts tomorrow. We’ve got Ministry cars again, 
and there will be Aurors waiting at the station — ” 

“Is Tonks going to be there?” asked Harry, handing 
over his Quidditch things. 

“No, I don’t think so, she’s been stationed somewhere 
else from what Arthur said.” 

“She has let ’erself go, zat Tonks,” Fleur mused, 
examining her own stunning reflection in the back of 
a teaspoon. “A big mistake if you ask — ” 

“Yes, thank you,” said Mrs. Weasley tartly, cutting 
across Fleur again. “You’d better get on, Harry, I want 
the trunks ready tonight, if possible, so we don’t have 
the usual last-minute scramble.” 



Page | 147 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




And in fact, their departure the following morning was 
smoother than usual. The Ministry cars glided up to 
the front of the Burrow to find them waiting, trunks 
packed; Hermione’s cat, Crookshanks, safely enclosed 
in his traveling basket; and Hedwig; Ron’s owl, 
Pigwidgeon; and Ginny’s new purple Pygmy Puff, 
Arnold, in cages. 

“Au revoir, ’Ariy,” said Fleur throatily, kissing him 
good-bye. Ron hurried forward, looking hopeful, but 
Ginny stuck out her foot and Ron fell, sprawling in 
the dust at Fleur’s feet. Furious, red-faced, and dirt- 
spattered, he hurried into the car without saying 
good-bye. 

There was no cheerful Hagrid waiting for them at 
King’s Cross Station. Instead, two grim-faced, 
bearded Aurors in dark Muggle suits moved forward 
the moment the cars stopped and, flanking the party, 
marched them into the station without speaking. 

“Quick, quick, through the barrier,” said Mrs. 

Weasley, who seemed a little flustered by this austere 
efficiency. “Harry had better go first, with — ” 

She looked inquiringly at one of the Aurors, who 
nodded briefly, seized Harry’s upper arm, and 
attempted to steer him toward the barrier between 
platforms nine and ten. 

“I can walk, thanks,” said Harry irritably, jerking his 
arm out of the Auror’s grip. He pushed his trolley 
directly at the solid barrier, ignoring his silent 
companion, and found himself, a second later, 
standing on platform nine and three-quarters, where 
the scarlet Hogwarts Express stood belching steam 
over the crowd. 



Page | 148 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Hermione and the Weasleys joined him within 
seconds. Without waiting to consult his grim-faced 
Auror, Harry motioned to Ron and Hermione to follow 
him up the platform, looking for an empty 
compartment. 

“We can’t, Harry,” said Hermione, looking apologetic. 
“Ron and I’ve got to go to the prefects’ carriage first 
and then patrol the corridors for a bit.” 

“Oh yeah, I forgot,” said Harry. 

“You’d better get straight on the train, all of you, 
you’ve only got a few minutes to go,” said Mrs. 
Weasley, consulting her watch. “Well, have a lovely 
term, Ron. ...” 

“Mr. Weasley, can I have a quick word?” said Harry, 
making up his mind on the spur of the moment. 

“Of course,” said Mr. Weasley, who looked slightly 
surprised, but followed Harry out of earshot of the 
others nevertheless. 

Harry had thought it through carefully and come to 
the conclusion that, if he was to tell anyone, Mr. 
Weasley was the right person; firstly, because he 
worked at the Ministry and was therefore in the best 
position to make further investigations, and secondly, 
because he thought that there was not too much risk 
of Mr. Weasley exploding with anger. 

He could see Mrs. Weasley and the grim-faced Auror 
casting the pair of them suspicious looks as they 
moved away. 

“When we were in Diagon Alley,” Harry began, but Mr. 
Weasley forestalled him with a grimace. 



Page | 149 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Am I about to discover where you, Ron, and 
Hermione disappeared to while you were supposed to 
be in the back room of Fred and George’s shop?” 

“How did you — ?” 

“Harry, please. You’re talking to the man who raised 
Fred and George.” 

“Er ... yeah, all right, we weren’t in the back room.” 

“Very well, then, let’s hear the worst.” 

“Well, we followed Draco Malfoy. We used my 
Invisibility Cloak.” 

“Did you have any particular reason for doing so, or 
was it a mere whim?” 

“Because I thought Malfoy was up to something,” said 
Harry, disregarding Mr. Weasley’s look of mingled 
exasperation and amusement. “He’d given his mother 
the slip and I wanted to know why.” 

“Of course you did,” said Mr. Weasley, sounding 
resigned. “Well? Did you find out why?” 

“He went into Borgin and Burkes,” said Harry, “and 
started bullying the bloke in there, Borgin, to help 
him fix something. And he said he wanted Borgin to 
keep something else for him. He made it sound like it 
was the same kind of thing that needed fixing. Like 
they were a pair. And ...” 

Harry took a deep breath. 

“There’s something else. We saw Malfoy jump about a 
mile when Madam Malkin tried to touch his left arm. I 



Page | 150 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




think he’s been branded with the Dark Mark. I think 
he’s replaced his father as a Death Eater.” 

Mr. Weasley looked taken aback. After a moment he 
said, “Harry, I doubt whether You-Know-Who would 
allow a sixteen-year-old — ” 

“Does anyone really know what You-Know-Who would 
or wouldn’t do?” asked Harry angrily. “Mr. Weasley, 
I’m sorry, but isn’t it worth investigating? If Malfoy 
wants something fixing, and he needs to threaten 
Borgin to get it done, it’s probably something Dark or 
dangerous, isn’t it?” 

“I doubt it, to be honest, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley 
slowly. “You see, when Lucius Malfoy was arrested, 
we raided his house. We took away everything that 
might have been dangerous.” 

“I think you missed something,” said Harry 
stubbornly. 

“Well, maybe,” said Mr. Weasley, but Harry could tell 
that Mr. Weasley was humoring him. 

There was a whistle behind them; nearly everyone 
had boarded the train and the doors were closing. 

“You’d better hurry,” said Mr. Weasley, as Mrs. 
Weasley cried, “Harry, quickly!” 

He hurried forward and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley helped 
him load his trunk onto the train. 

“Now, dear, you’re coming to us for Christmas, it’s all 
fixed with Dumbledore, so we’ll see you quite soon,” 
said Mrs. Weasley through the window, as Harry 
slammed the door shut behind him and the train 



Page | 151 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




began to move. “You make sure you look after 
yourself and — ” 



The train was gathering speed. 

“ — be good and — ” 

She was jogging to keep up now. 
stay safe!” 

Harry waved until the train had turned a corner and 
Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were lost to view, then turned 
to see where the others had got to. He supposed Ron 
and Hermione were cloistered in the prefects’ 
carriage, but Ginny was a little way along the 
corridor, chatting to some friends. He made his way 
toward her, dragging his trunk. 

People stared shamelessly as he approached. They 
even pressed their faces against the windows of their 
compartments to get a look at him. He had expected 
an upswing in the amount of gaping and gawping he 
would have to endure this term after all the “Chosen 
One” rumors in the Daily Prophet, but he did not 
enjoy the sensation of standing in a very bright 
spotlight. He tapped Ginny on the shoulder. 

“Fancy trying to find a compartment?” 

“I can’t, Harry, I said I’d meet Dean,” said Ginny 
brightly. “See you later.” 

“Right,” said Harry. He felt a strange twinge of 
annoyance as she walked away, her long red hair 
dancing behind her; he had become so used to her 
presence over the summer that he had almost 
forgotten that Ginny did not hang around with him, 
Ron, and Hermione while at school. Then he blinked 
Page | 152 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




and looked around: He was surrounded by 
mesmerized girls. 

“Hi, Harry!” said a familiar voice from behind him. 

“Neville!” said Harry in relief, turning to see a round- 
faced boy struggling toward him. 

“Hello, Harry,” said a girl with long hair and large 
misty eyes, who was just behind Neville. 

“Luna, hi, how are you?” 

“Very well, thank you,” said Luna. She was clutching 
a magazine to her chest; large letters on the front 
announced that there was a pair of free Spectrespecs 
inside. 

“Quibbler still going strong, then?” asked Harry, who 
felt a certain fondness for the magazine, having given 
it an exclusive interview the previous year. 

“Oh yes, circulation’s well up,” said Luna happily. 

“Let’s find seats,” said Harry, and the three of them 
set off along the train through hordes of silently 
staring students. At last they found an empty 
compartment, and Harry hurried inside gratefully. 

“They’re even staring at us!” said Neville, indicating 
himself and Luna. “Because we’re with you!” 

“They’re staring at you because you were at the 
Ministry too,” said Harry, as he hoisted his trunk into 
the luggage rack. “Our little adventure there was all 
over the Daily Prophet, you must’ve seen it.” 

“Yes, I thought Gran would be angry about all the 
publicity,” said Neville, “but she was really pleased. 

Page | 153 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Says I’m starting to live up to my dad at long last. She 
bought me a new wand, look!” 



He pulled it out and showed it to Harry. 

“Cherry and unicorn hair,” he said proudly. “We think 
it was one of the last Ollivander ever sold, he 
vanished next day — oi, come back here, Trevor!” 

And he dived under the seat to retrieve his toad as it 
made one of its frequent bids for freedom. 

“Are we still doing D.A. meetings this year, Harry?” 
asked Luna, who was detaching a pair of psychedelic 
spectacles from the middle of The Quibbler. 

“No point now we’ve got rid of Umbridge, is there?” 
said Harry, sitting down. Neville bumped his head 
against the seat as he emerged from under it. He 
looked most disappointed. 

“I liked the D.A.! I learned loads with you!” 

“I enjoyed the meetings too,” said Luna serenely. “It 
was like having friends.” 

This was one of those uncomfortable things Luna 
often said and which made Harry feel a squirming 
mixture of pity and embarrassment. Before he could 
respond, however, there was a disturbance outside 
their compartment door; a group of fourth-year girls 
was whispering and giggling together on the other 
side of the glass. 

“You ask him!” 

“No, you!” 

“I’ll do it!” 

Page | 154 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




And one of them, a bold-looking girl with large dark 
eyes, a prominent chin, and long black hair pushed 
her way through the door. 

“Hi, Harry, I’m Romilda, Romilda Vane,” she said 
loudly and confidently. “Why don’t you join us in our 
compartment? You don’t have to sit with them,” she 
added in a stage whisper, indicating Neville’s bottom, 
which was sticking out from under the seat again as 
he groped around for Trevor, and Luna, who was now 
wearing her free Spectrespecs, which gave her the 
look of a demented, multicolored owl. 

“They’re friends of mine,” said Harry coldly. 

“Oh,” said the girl, looking very surprised. “Oh. 

Okay.” 

And she withdrew, sliding the door closed behind her. 

“People expect you to have cooler friends than us,” 
said Luna, once again displaying her knack for 
embarrassing honesty. 

“You are cool,” said Harry shortly. “None of them was 
at the Ministry. They didn’t fight with me.” 

“That’s a very nice thing to say,” beamed Luna. Then 
she pushed her Spectrespecs farther up her nose and 
settled down to read The Quibbler. 

“We didn’t face him, though,” said Neville, emerging 
from under the seat with fluff and dust in his hair 
and a resigned-looking Trevor in his hand. “You did. 
You should hear my gran talk about you. ‘That Harry 
Potter’s got more backbone than the whole Ministry of 
Magic put together*.’ She’d give anything to have you 
as a grandson. ...” 



Page | 155 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Harry laughed uncomfortably and changed the 
subject to O.W.L. results as soon as he could. While 
Neville recited his grades and wondered aloud 
whether he would be allowed to take a 
Transfiguration N.E.W.T. with only an “Acceptable,” 
Harry watched him without really listening. 

Neville’s childhood had been blighted by Voldemort 
just as much as Harry’s had, but Neville had no idea 
how close he had come to having Harry’s destiny. The 
prophecy could have referred to either of them, yet, 
for his own inscrutable reasons, Voldemort had 
chosen to believe that Harry was the one meant. 

Had Voldemort chosen Neville, it would be Neville 
sitting opposite Harry bearing the lightning-shaped 
scar and the weight of the prophecy. ... Or would it? 
Would Neville’s mother have died to save him, as Lily 
had died for Harry? Surely she would. ... But what if 
she had been unable to stand between her son and 
Voldemort? Would there then have been no “Chosen 
One” at all? An empty seat where Neville now sat and 
a scarless Harry who would have been kissed good- 
bye by his own mother, not Ron’s? 

“You all right, Harry? You look funny,” said Neville. 

Harry started. “Sorry — I — ” 

“Wrackspurt got you?” asked Luna sympathetically, 
peering at Harry through her enormous colored 
spectacles. 

“I — what?” 

“A Wrackspurt ... They’re invisible. They float in 
through your ears and make your brain go fuzzy,” she 
said. “I thought I felt one zooming around in here.” 



Page | 156 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




She flapped her hands at thin air, as though beating 
off large invisible moths. Harry and Neville caught 
each other’s eyes and hastily began to talk of 
Quidditch. 

The weather beyond the train windows was as patchy 
as it had been all summer; they passed through 
stretches of the chilling mist, then out into weak, 
clear sunlight. It was during one of the clear spells, 
when the sun was visible almost directly overhead, 
that Ron and Hermione entered the compartment at 
last. 

“Wish the lunch trolley would hurry up, I’m starving,” 
said Ron longingly, slumping into the seat beside 
Harry and rubbing his stomach. “Hi, Neville. Hi, 

Luna. Guess what?” he added, turning to Harry. 
“Malfoy’s not doing prefect duty. He’s just sitting in 
his compartment with the other Slytherins, we saw 
him when we passed.” 

Harry sat up straight, interested. It was not like 
Malfoy to pass up the chance to demonstrate his 
power as prefect, which he had happily abused all the 
previous year. 

“What did he do when he saw you?” 

“The usual,” said Ron indifferently, demonstrating a 
rude hand gesture. “Not like him, though, is it? Well 
— that is” — he did the hand gesture again — “but 
why isn’t he out there bullying first years? 

“Dunno,” said Harry, but his mind was racing. Didn’t 
this look as though Malfoy had more important things 
on his mind than bullying younger students? 



Page | 157 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Maybe he preferred the Inquisitorial Squad,” said 
Hermione. “Maybe being a prefect seems a bit tame 
after that.” 



“I don’t think so,” said Harry. “I think he’s — ” 

But before he could expound on his theory, the 
compartment door slid open again and a breathless 
third -year girl stepped inside. 

“I’m supposed to deliver these to Neville Longbottom 
and Harry P-Potter,” she faltered, as her eyes met 
Harry’s and she turned scarlet. She was holding out 
two scrolls of parchment tied with violet ribbon. 
Perplexed, Harry and Neville took the scroll addressed 
to each of them and the girl stumbled back out of the 
compartment. 

“What is it?” Ron demanded, as Harry unrolled his. 
“An invitation,” said Harry. 

Harry, 

I would be delighted if you would join me for a bite of 
lunch in compartment C. 

Sincerely, 

Professor H. E. F. Slug horn 

“Who’s Professor Slughorn?” asked Neville, looking 
perplexedly at his own invitation. 

“New teacher,” said Harry. “Well, I suppose we’ll have 
to go, won’t we?” 

“But what does he want me for?” asked Neville 
nervously, as though he was expecting detention.

“No idea,” said Harry, which was not entirely true, 
though he had no proof yet that his hunch was 
correct. “Listen,” he added, seized by a sudden brain 
wave, “let’s go under the Invisibility Cloak, then we 
might get a good look at Malfoy on the way, see what 
he’s up to.” 

This idea, however, came to nothing: The corridors, 
which were packed with people on the lookout for the 
lunch trolley, were impossible to negotiate while 
wearing the cloak. Harry stowed it regretfully back in 
his bag, reflecting that it would have been nice to 
wear it just to avoid all the staring, which seemed to 
have increased in intensity even since he had last 
walked down the train. Every now and then, students 
would hurtle out of their compartments to get a better 
look at him. The exception was Cho Chang, who 
darted into her compartment when she saw Harry 
coming. As Harry passed the window, he saw her 
deep in determined conversation with her friend 
Marietta, who was wearing a very thick layer of 
makeup that did not entirely obscure the odd 
formation of pimples still etched across her face. 
Smirking slightly, Harry pushed on. 

When they reached compartment C, they saw at once 
that they were not Slughorn’s only invitees, although 
judging by the enthusiasm of Slughorn’s welcome, 
Harry was the most warmly anticipated. 

“Harry, m’boy!” said Slughorn, jumping up at the 
sight of him so that his great velvet-covered belly 
seemed to fill all the remaining space in the 
compartment. His shiny bald head and great silvery 
mustache gleamed as brightly in the sunlight as the 
golden buttons on his waistcoat. “Good to see you, 
good to see you! And you must be Mr. Longbottom!” 



Page | 159 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Neville nodded, looking scared. At a gesture from 
Slughorn, they sat down opposite each other in the 
only two empty seats, which were nearest the door. 
Harry glanced around at their fellow guests. He 
recognized a Slytherin from their year, a tall black boy 
with high cheekbones and long, slanting eyes; there 
were also two seventh-year boys Harry did not know 
and, squashed in the corner beside Slughorn and 
looking as though she was not entirely sure how she 
had got there, Ginny. 

“Now, do you know everyone?” Slughorn asked Harry 
and Neville. “Blaise Zabini is in your year, of course — 



Zabini did not make any sign of recognition or 
greeting, nor did Harry or Neville: Gryffindor and 
Slytherin students loathed each other on principle. 

“This is Cormac McLaggen, perhaps you’ve come 
across each other — ? No?” 

McLaggen, a large, wiry-haired youth, raised a hand, 
and Harry and Neville nodded back at him. 

“ — and this is Marcus Belby, I don’t know whether — 
?” 

Belby, who was thin and nervous-looking, gave a 
strained smile. 

“ — and this charming young lady tells me she knows 
you!” Slughorn finished. 

Ginny grimaced at Harry and Neville from behind 
Slughorn’s back. 

“Well now, this is most pleasant,” said Slughorn 
cozily. “A chance to get to know you all a little better. 

Page | 160 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Here, take a napkin. I’ve packed my own lunch; the 
trolley, as I remember it, is heavy on licorice wands, 
and a poor old man’s digestive system isn’t quite up 
to such things. ... Pheasant, Belby?” 

Belby started and accepted what looked like half a 
cold pheasant. 

“I was just telling young Marcus here that I had the 
pleasure of teaching his Uncle Damocles,” Slughorn 
told Harry and Neville, now passing around a basket 
of rolls. “Outstanding wizard, outstanding, and his 
Order of Merlin most well-deserved. Do you see much 
of your uncle, Marcus?” 

Unfortunately, Belby had just taken a large mouthful 
of pheasant; in his haste to answer Slughorn he 
swallowed too fast, turned purple, and began to 
choke. 

“Anapneo,” said Slughorn calmly, pointing his wand 
at Belby, whose airway seemed to clear at once. 

“Not ... not much of him, no,” gasped Belby, his eyes 
streaming. 

“Well, of course, I daresay he’s busy,” said Slughorn, 
looking questioningly at Belby. “I doubt he invented 
the Wolfsbane Potion without considerable hard 
work!” 

“I suppose ...” said Belby, who seemed afraid to take 
another bite of pheasant until he was sure that 
Slughorn had finished with him. “Er ... he and my 
dad don’t get on very well, you see, so I don’t really 
know much about ...” 

His voice tailed away as Slughorn gave him a cold 
smile and turned to McLaggen instead. 

Page | 161 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Now, you, Cormac,” said Slughorn, “I happen to 
know you see a lot of your Uncle Tiberius, because he 
has a rather splendid picture of the two of you 
hunting nogtails in, I think, Norfolk?” 

“Oh, yeah, that was fun, that was,” said McLaggen. 
“We went with Bertie Higgs and Rufus Scrimgeour — 
this was before he became Minister, obviously — ” 

“Ah, you know Bertie and Rufus too?” beamed 
Slughorn, now offering around a small tray of pies; 
somehow, Belby was missed out. “Now tell me ...” 

It was as Harry had suspected. Everyone here seemed 
to have been invited because they were connected to 
somebody well-known or influential — everyone 
except Ginny. Zabini, who was interrogated after 
McLaggen, turned out to have a famously beautiful 
witch for a mother (from what Harry could make out, 
she had been married seven times, each of her 
husbands dying mysteriously and leaving her mounds 
of gold). It was Neville’s turn next: This was a very 
uncomfortable ten minutes, for Neville’s parents, well- 
known Aurors, had been tortured into insanity by 
Bellatrix Lestrange and a couple of Death Eater 
cronies. At the end of Neville’s interview, Harry had 
the impression that Slughorn was reserving judgment 
on Neville, yet to see whether he had any of his 
parents’ flair. 

“And now,” said Slughorn, shifting massively in his 
seat with the air of a compere introducing his star 
act. “Harry Potter! Where to begin? I feel I barely 
scratched the surface when we met over the summer!” 
He contemplated Harry for a moment as though he 
was a particularly large and succulent piece of 
pheasant, then said, “ The Chosen One,’ they’re 
calling you now!” 



Page | 162 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Harry said nothing. Belby, McLaggen, and Zabini 
were all staring at him. 



“Of course,” said Slughorn, watching Harry closely, 
“there have been rumors for years. ... I remember 
when — well — after that terrible night — Lily — 
James — and you survived — and the word was that 
you must have powers beyond the ordinary — ” 

Zabini gave a tiny little cough that was clearly 
supposed to indicate amused skepticism. An angry 
voice burst out from behind Slughorn. 

“Yeah, Zabini, because you’re so talented ... at posing. 



“Oh dear!” chuckled Slughorn comfortably, looking 
around at Ginny, who was glaring at Zabini around 
Slughorn ’s great belly. “You want to be careful, Blaise! 
I saw this young lady perform the most marvelous 
Bat-Bogey Hex as I was passing her carriage! I 
wouldn’t cross her!” 

Zabini merely looked contemptuous. 

“Anyway,” said Slughorn, turning back to Harry. 

“Such rumors this summer. Of course, one doesn’t 
know what to believe, the Prophet has been known to 
print inaccuracies, make mistakes — but there seems 
little doubt, given the number of witnesses, that there 
was quite a disturbance at the Ministry and that you 
were there in the thick of it all!” 

Harry, who could not see any way out of this without 
flatly lying, nodded but still said nothing. Slughorn 
beamed at him. 

“So modest, so modest, no wonder Dumbledore is so 
fond — you were there, then? But the rest of the 

Page | 163 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




stories — so sensational, of course, one doesn’t know 
quite what to believe — this fabled prophecy, for 
instance — ” 

“We never heard a prophecy,” said Neville, turning 
geranium pink as he said it. 

“That’s right,” said Ginny staunchly. “Neville and I 
were both there too, and all this ‘Chosen One’ rubbish 
is just the Prophet making things up as usual.” 

“You were both there too, were you?” said Slughorn 
with great interest, looking from Ginny to Neville, but 
both of them sat clamlike before his encouraging 
smile. 

“Yes . . . well ... it is true that the Prophet often 
exaggerates, of course. ...” Slughorn said, sounding a 
little disappointed. “I remember dear Gwenog telling 
me (Gwenog Jones, I mean, of course, Captain of the 
Holyhead Harpies) — ” 

He meandered off into a long-winded reminiscence, 
but Harry had the distinct impression that Slughorn 
had not finished with him, and that he had not been 
convinced by Neville and Ginny. 

The afternoon wore on with more anecdotes about 
illustrious wizards Slughorn had taught, all of whom 
had been delighted to join what he called the “Slug 
Club” at Hogwarts. Harry could not wait to leave, but 
couldn’t see how to do so politely. Finally the train 
emerged from yet another long misty stretch into a 
red sunset, and Slughorn looked around, blinking in 
the twilight. 

“Good gracious, it’s getting dark already! I didn’t 
notice that they’d lit the lamps! You’d better go and 
change into your robes, all of you. McLaggen, you 

Page | 164 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




must drop by and borrow that book on nogtails. 

Harry, Blaise — any time you’re passing. Same goes 
for you, miss,” he twinkled at Ginny. “Well, off you go, 
off you go!” 

As he pushed past Harry into the darkening corridor, 
Zabini shot him a filthy look that Harry returned with 
interest. He, Ginny, and Neville followed Zabini back 
along the train. 

“I’m glad that’s over,” muttered Neville. “Strange man, 
isn’t he?” 

“Yeah, he is a bit,” said Harry, his eyes on Zabini. 
“How come you ended up in there, Ginny?” 

“He saw me hex Zacharias Smith,” said Ginny. “You 
remember that idiot from Hufflepuff who was in the 
D.A.? He kept on and on asking about what happened 
at the Ministry and in the end he annoyed me so 
much I hexed him — when Slughorn came in I 
thought I was going to get detention, but he just 
thought it was a really good hex and invited me to 
lunch! Mad, eh?” 

“Better reason for inviting someone than because 
their mother’s famous,” said Harry, scowling at the 
back of Zabini ’s head, “or because their uncle — ” 

But he broke off. An idea had just occurred to him, a 
reckless but potentially wonderful idea. ... In a 
minute’s time, Zabini was going to reenter the 
Slytherin sixth-year compartment and Malfoy would 
be sitting there, thinking himself unheard by anybody 
except fellow Slytherins. ... If Harry could only enter, 
unseen, behind him, what might he not see or hear? 
True, there was little of the journey left — Hogsmeade 
Station had to be less than half an hour away, 
judging by the wildness of the scenery flashing by the 
Page | 165 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




windows — but nobody else seemed prepared to take 
Harry’s suspicions seriously, so it was down to him to 
prove them. 

“I’ll see you two later,” said Harry under his breath, 
pulling out his Invisibility Cloak and flinging it over 
himself. 

“But what’re you — ?” asked Neville. 

“Later!” whispered Harry, darting after Zabini as 
quietly as possible, though the rattling of the train 
made such caution almost pointless. 

The corridors were almost completely empty now. 
Nearly everyone had returned to their carriages to 
change into their school robes and pack up their 
possessions. Though he was as close as he could get 
to Zabini without touching him, Harry was not quick 
enough to slip into the compartment when Zabini 
opened the door. Zabini was already sliding it shut 
when Harry hastily stuck out his foot to prevent it 
closing. 

“What’s wrong with this thing?” said Zabini angrily as 
he smashed the sliding door repeatedly into Harry’s 
foot. 

Harry seized the door and pushed it open, hard; 
Zabini, still clinging on to the handle, toppled over 
sideways into Gregory Goyle’s lap, and in the ensuing 
ruckus, Harry darted into the compartment, leapt 
onto Zabini’s temporarily empty seat, and hoisted 
himself up into the luggage rack. It was fortunate that 
Goyle and Zabini were snarling at each other, drawing 
all eyes onto them, for Harry was quite sure his feet 
and ankles had been revealed as the cloak had 
flapped around them; indeed, for one horrible 
moment he thought he saw Malfoy’s eyes follow his 
Page | 166 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




trainer as it whipped upward out of sight. But then 
Goyle slammed the door shut and flung Zabini off 
him; Zabini collapsed into his own seat looking 
ruffled, Vincent Crabbe returned to his comic, and 
Malfoy, sniggering, lay back down across two seats 
with his head in Pansy Parkinson’s lap. Harry lay 
curled uncomfortably under the cloak to ensure that 
every inch of him remained hidden, and watched 
Pansy stroke the sleek blond hair off Malfoy’s 
forehead, smirking as she did so, as though anyone 
would have loved to have been in her place. The 
lanterns swinging from the carriage ceiling cast a 
bright light over the scene: Harry could read every 
word of Crabbe’s comic directly below him. 

“So, Zabini,” said Malfoy, “what did Slughorn want?” 

“Just trying to make up to well-connected people,” 
said Zabini, who was still glowering at Goyle. “Not 
that he managed to find many.” 

This information did not seem to please Malfoy. 

“Who else had he invited?” he demanded. 

“McLaggen from Gryffindor,” said Zabini. 

“Oh yeah, his uncle’s big in the Ministry,” said 
Malfoy. 

“ — someone else called Belby, from Ravenclaw — ” 

“Not him, he’s a prat!” said Pansy. 

“ — and Longbottom, Potter, and that Weasley girl,” 
finished Zabini. 

Malfoy sat up very suddenly, knocking Pansy’s hand 
aside. 

Page | 167 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“He invited Longbottom?” 

“Well, I assume so, as Longbottom was there,” said 
Zabini indifferently. 

“What’s Longbottom got to interest Slughorn?” 

Zabini shrugged. 

“Potter, precious Potter, obviously he wanted a look at 
‘the Chosen One,’ ” sneered Malfoy, “but that Weasley 
girl! What’s so special about her?” 

“A lot of boys like her,” said Pansy, watching Malfoy 
out of the corner of her eyes for his reaction. “Even 
you think she’s good-looking, don’t you, Blaise, and 
we all know how hard you are to please!” 

“I wouldn’t touch a filthy little blood traitor like her 
whatever she looked like,” said Zabini coldly, and 
Pansy looked pleased. Malfoy sank back across her 
lap and allowed her to resume the stroking of his 
hair. 

“Well, I pity Slughorn’s taste. Maybe he’s going a bit 
senile. Shame, my father always said he was a good 
wizard in his day. My father used to be a bit of a 
favorite of his. Slughorn probably hasn’t heard I’m on 
the train, or — ” 

“I wouldn’t bank on an invitation,” said Zabini. “He 
asked me about Nott’s father when I first arrived. 

They used to be old friends, apparently, but when he 
heard he’d been caught at the Ministry he didn’t look 
happy, and Nott didn’t get an invitation, did he? I 
don’t think Slughorn’s interested in Death Eaters.” 

Malfoy looked angry, but forced out a singularly 
humorless laugh. 

Page | 168 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Well, who cares what he’s interested in? What is he, 
when you come down to it? Just some stupid 
teacher.” Malfoy yawned ostentatiously. “I mean, I 
might not even be at Hogwarts next year, what’s it 
matter to me if some fat old has-been likes me or 
not?” 

“What do you mean, you might not be at Hogwarts 
next year?” said Pansy indignantly, ceasing grooming 
Malfoy at once. 

“Well, you never know,” said Malfoy with the ghost of 
a smirk. “I might have — er — moved on to bigger and 
better things.” 

Crouched in the luggage rack under his cloak, Harry’s 
heart began to race. What would Ron and Hermione 
say about this? Crabbe and Goyle were gawping at 
Malfoy; apparently they had had no inkling of any 
plans to move on to bigger and better things. Even 
Zabini had allowed a look of curiosity to mar his 
haughty features. Pansy resumed the slow stroking of 
Malfoy’s hair, looking dumbfounded. 

“Do you mean — Him?” 

Malfoy shrugged. 

“Mother wants me to complete my education, but 
personally, I don’t see it as that important these days. 
I mean, think about it. ... When the Dark Lord takes 
over, is he going to care how many O.W.L.s or 
N.E.W.T.s anyone’s got? Of course he isn’t. ... It’ll be 
all about the kind of service he received, the level of 
devotion he was shown.” 

“And you think you’ll be able to do something for 
him?” asked Zabini scathingly. “Sixteen years old and 
not even fully qualified yet?” 

Page | 169 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“I’ve just said, haven’t I? Maybe he doesn’t care if I’m 
qualified. Maybe the job he wants me to do isn’t 
something that you need to be qualified for,” said 
Malfoy quietly. 

Crabbe and Goyle were both sitting with their mouths 
open like gargoyles. Pansy was gazing down at Malfoy 
as though she had never seen anything so awe- 
inspiring. 

“I can see Hogwarts,” said Malfoy, clearly relishing the 
effect he had created as he pointed out of the 
blackened window. “We’d better get our robes on.” 

Harry was so busy staring at Malfoy, he did not notice 
Goyle reaching up for his trunk; as he swung it down, 
it hit Harry hard on the side of the head. He let out an 
involuntary gasp of pain, and Malfoy looked up at the 
luggage rack, frowning. 

Harry was not afraid of Malfoy, but he still did not 
much like the idea of being discovered hiding under 
his Invisibility Cloak by a group of unfriendly 
Slytherins. Eyes still watering and head still 
throbbing, he drew his wand, careful not to 
disarrange the cloak, and waited, breath held. To his 
relief, Malfoy seemed to decide that he had imagined 
the noise; he pulled on his robes like the others, 
locked his trunk, and as the train slowed to a jerky 
crawl, fastened a thick new traveling cloak round his 
neck. 

Harry could see the corridors filling up again and 
hoped that Hermione and Ron would take his things 
out onto the platform for him; he was stuck where he 
was until the compartment had quite emptied. At last, 
with a final lurch, the train came to a complete halt. 
Goyle threw the door open and muscled his way out 



Page | 170 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




into a crowd of second years, punching them aside; 
Crabbe and Zabini followed. 

“You go on,” Malfoy told Pansy, who was waiting for 
him with her hand held out as though hoping he 
would hold it. “I just want to check something.” 

Pansy left. Now Harry and Malfoy were alone in the 
compartment. People were filing past, descending 
onto the dark platform. Malfoy moved over to the 
compartment door and let down the blinds, so that 
people in the corridor beyond could not peer in. He 
then bent down over his trunk and opened it again. 

Harry peered down over the edge of the luggage rack, 
his heart pumping a little faster. What had Malfoy 
wanted to hide from Pansy? Was he about to see the 
mysterious broken object it was so important to 
mend? 

“Petrificus Totalusl” 

Without warning, Malfoy pointed his wand at Harry, 
who was instantly paralyzed. As though in slow 
motion, he toppled out of the luggage rack and fell, 
with an agonizing, floor-shaking crash, at Malfoy’s 
feet, the Invisibility Cloak trapped beneath him, his 
whole body revealed with his legs still curled absurdly 
into the cramped kneeling position. He couldn’t move 
a muscle; he could only gaze up at Malfoy, who 
smiled broadly. 

“I thought so,” he said jubilantly. “I heard Goyle’s 
trunk hit you. And I thought I saw something white 
flash through the air after Zabini came back. ...” 

His eyes lingered for a moment upon Harry’s trainers. 



Page | 171 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“You didn’t hear anything I care about, Potter. But 
while I’ve got you here ...” 

And he stamped, hard, on Harry’s face. Harry felt his 
nose break; blood spurted everywhere. 

“That’s from my father. Now, let’s see. ...” 

Malfoy dragged the cloak out from under Harry’s 
immobilized body and threw it over him. 

“I don’t reckon they’ll find you till the train’s back in 
London,” he said quietly. “See you around, Potter ... 
or not.” 

And taking care to tread on Harry’s fingers, Malfoy 
left the compartment. 



Page | 172 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 






SNAPE VICTORIOUS 

Harry could not move a muscle. He lay there beneath 
the Invisibility Cloak feeling the blood from his nose 
flow, hot and wet, over his face, listening to the voices 
and footsteps in the corridor beyond. His immediate 
thought was that someone, surely, would check the 
compartments before the train departed again. But at 
once came the dispiriting realization that even if 
somebody looked into the compartment, he would be 
neither seen nor heard. His best hope was that 
somebody else would walk in and step on him. 

Harry had never hated Malfoy more than as he lay 
there, like an absurd turtle on its back, blood 
dripping sickeningly into his open mouth. What a 
stupid situation to have landed himself in . . . and now 
the last few footsteps were dying away; everyone was 
shuffling along the dark platform outside; he could 
hear the scraping of trunks and the loud babble of 
talk. 



Page | 173 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 



Ron and Hermione would think that he had left the 
train without them. Once they arrived at Hogwarts 
and took their places in the Great Hall, looked up and 
down the Gryffindor table a few times, and finally 
realized that he was not there, he, no doubt, would be 
halfway back to London. 

He tried to make a sound, even a grunt, but it was 
impossible. Then he remembered that some wizards, 
like Dumbledore, could perform spells without 
speaking, so he tried to summon his wand, which had 
fallen out of his hand, by saying the words “Accio 
Wand\” over and over again in his head, but nothing 
happened. 

He thought he could hear the rustling of the trees 
that surrounded the lake, and the far-off hoot of an 
owl, but no hint of a search being made or even (he 
despised himself slightly for hoping it) panicked 
voices wondering where Harry Potter had gone. A 
feeling of hopelessness spread through him as he 
imagined the convoy of thestral-drawn carriages 
trundling up to the school and the muffled yells of 
laughter issuing from whichever carriage Malfoy was 
riding in, where he could be recounting his attack on 
Harry to Crabbe, Goyle, Zabini, and Pansy Parkinson. 

The train lurched, causing Harry to roll over onto his 
side. Now he was staring at the dusty underside of 
the seats instead of the ceiling. The floor began to 
vibrate as the engine roared into life. The Express was 
leaving and nobody knew he was still on it. ... 

Then he felt his Invisibility Cloak fly off him and a 
voice overhead said, “Wotcher, Harry.” 

There was a flash of red light and Harry’s body 
unfroze; he was able to push himself into a more 
dignified sitting position, hastily wipe the blood off his 

Page | 174 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




bruised face with the back of his hand, and raise his 
head to look up at Tonks, who was holding the 
Invisibility Cloak she had just pulled away. 

“We’d better get out of here, quickly,” she said, as the 
train windows became obscured with steam and they 
began to move out of the station. “Come on, we’ll 
jump.” 

Harry hurried after her into the corridor. She pulled 
open the train door and leapt onto the platform, 
which seemed to be sliding underneath them as the 
train gathered momentum. He followed her, staggered 
a little on landing, then straightened up in time to see 
the gleaming scarlet steam engine pick up speed, 
round the corner, and disappear from view. 

The cold night air was soothing on his throbbing 
nose. Tonks was looking at him; he felt angry and 
embarrassed that he had been discovered in such a 
ridiculous position. Silently she handed him back the 
Invisibility Cloak. 

“Who did it?” 

“Draco Malfoy,” said Harry bitterly. “Thanks for ... 
well ...” 

“No problem,” said Tonks, without smiling. From 
what Harry could see in the darkness, she was as 
mousy-haired and miserable-looking as she had been 
when he had met her at the Burrow. “I can fix your 
nose if you stand still.” 

Harry did not think much of this idea; he had been 
intending to visit Madam Pomfrey, the matron, in 
whom he had a little more confidence when it came to 
Healing Spells, but it seemed rude to say this, so he 
stayed stock-still and closed his eyes. 

Page | 175 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Episkey,” said Tonks. 



Harry’s nose felt very hot, and then very cold. He 
raised a hand and felt it gingerly. It seemed to be 
mended. 

“Thanks a lot!” 

“You’d better put that cloak back on, and we can walk 
up to the school,” said Tonks, still unsmiling. As 
Harry swung the cloak back over himself, she waved 
her wand; an immense silvery four-legged creature 
erupted from it and streaked off into the darkness. 

“Was that a Patronus?” asked Harry, who had seen 
Dumbledore send messages like this. 

“Yes, I’m sending word to the castle that I’ve got you 
or they’ll worry. Come on, we’d better not dawdle.” 

They set off toward the lane that led to the school. 

“How did you find me?” 

“I noticed you hadn’t left the train and I knew you 
had that cloak. I thought you might be hiding for 
some reason. When I saw the blinds were drawn 
down on that compartment I thought I’d check.” 

“But what are you doing here, anyway?” Harry asked. 

“I’m stationed in Hogsmeade now, to give the school 
extra protection,” said Tonks. 

“Is it just you who’s stationed up here, or — ?” 

“No, Proudfoot, Savage, and Dawlish are here too.” 

“Dawlish, that Auror Dumbledore attacked last year?” 

Page | 176 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“That’s right.” 



They trudged up the dark, deserted lane, following the 
freshly made carriage tracks. Harry looked sideways 
at Tonks under his cloak. Last year she had been 
inquisitive (to the point of being a little annoying at 
times), she had laughed easily, she had made jokes. 
Now she seemed older and much more serious and 
purposeful. Was this all the effect of what had 
happened at the Ministry? He reflected uncomfortably 
that Hermione would have suggested he say 
something consoling about Sirius to her, that it 
hadn’t been her fault at all, but he couldn’t bring 
himself to do it. He was far from blaming her for 
Sirius’s death; it was no more her fault than anyone 
else’s (and much less than his), but he did not like 
talking about Sirius if he could avoid it. And so they 
tramped on through the cold night in silence, Tonks ’s 
long cloak whispering on the ground behind them. 

Having always traveled there by carriage, Harry had 
never before appreciated just how far Hogwarts was 
from Hogsmeade Station. With great relief he finally 
saw the tall pillars on either side of the gates, each 
topped with a winged boar. He was cold, he was 
hungry, and he was quite keen to leave this new, 
gloomy Tonks behind. But when he put out a hand to 
push open the gates, he found them chained shut. 

“Alohomora\” he said confidently, pointing his wand at 
the padlock, but nothing happened. 

“That won’t work on these,” said Tonks. “Dumbledore 
bewitched them himself.” 

Harry looked around. 

“I could climb a wall,” he suggested.

“No, you couldn’t,” said Tonks flatly. “Anti-intruder 
jinxes on all of them. Security’s been tightened a 
hundredfold this summer.” 

“Well then,” said Harry, starting to feel annoyed at her 
lack of helpfulness, “I suppose I’ll just have to sleep 
out here and wait for morning.” 

“Someone’s coming down for you,” said Tonks. “Look.” 

A lantern was bobbing at the distant foot of the 
castle. Harry was so pleased to see it he felt he could 
even endure Filch’s wheezy criticisms of his tardiness 
and rants about how his timekeeping would improve 
with the regular application of thumbscrews. It was 
not until the glowing yellow light was ten feet away 
from them, and Harry had pulled off his Invisibility 
Cloak so that he could be seen, that he recognized, 
with a rush of pure loathing, the uplit hooked nose 
and long, black, greasy hair of Severus Snape. 

“Well, well, well,” sneered Snape, taking out his wand 
and tapping the padlock once, so that the chains 
snaked backward and the gates creaked open. “Nice 
of you to turn up, Potter, although you have evidently 
decided that the wearing of school robes would 
detract from your appearance.” 

“I couldn’t change, I didn’t have my — ” Harry began, 
but Snape cut across him. 

“There is no need to wait, Nymphadora, Potter is quite 
— ah — safe in my hands.” 

“I meant Hagrid to get the message,” said Tonks, 
frowning. 

“Hagrid was late for the start-of-term feast, just like 
Potter here, so I took it instead. And incidentally,” 

Page | 178 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




said Snape, standing back to allow Harry to pass him, 
“I was interested to see your new Patronus.” 

He shut the gates in her face with a loud clang and 
tapped the chains with his wand again, so that they 
slithered, clinking, back into place. 

“I think you were better off with the old one,” said 
Snape, the malice in his voice unmistakable. “The 
new one looks weak.” 

As Snape swung the lantern about, Harry saw, 
fleetingly, a look of shock and anger on Tonks’s face. 
Then she was covered in darkness once more. 

“Good night,” Harry called to her over his shoulder, as 
he began the walk up to the school with Snape. 
“Thanks for ... everything.” 

“See you, Harry.” 

Snape did not speak for a minute or so. Harry felt as 
though his body was generating waves of hatred so 
powerful that it seemed incredible that Snape could 
not feel them burning him. He had loathed Snape 
from their first encounter, but Snape had placed 
himself forever and irrevocably beyond the possibility 
of Harry’s forgiveness by his attitude toward Sirius. 
Whatever Dumbledore said, Harry had had time to 
think over the summer, and had concluded that 
Snape ’s snide remarks to Sirius about remaining 
safely hidden while the rest of the Order of the 
Phoenix were off fighting Voldemort had probably 
been a powerful factor in Sirius rushing off to the 
Ministry the night that he had died. Harry clung to 
this notion, because it enabled him to blame Snape, 
which felt satisfying, and also because he knew that if 
anyone was not sorry that Sirius was dead, it was the 
man now striding next to him in the darkness. 

Page | 179 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Fifty points from Gryffindor for lateness, I think,” 
said Snape. “And, let me see, another twenty for your 
Muggle attire. You know, I don’t believe any House 
has ever been in negative figures this early in the 
term: We haven’t even started pudding. You might 
have set a record, Potter.” 

The fury and hatred bubbling inside Harry seemed to 
blaze white-hot, but he would rather have been 
immobilized all the way back to London than tell 
Snape why he was late. 

“I suppose you wanted to make an entrance, did 
you?” Snape continued. “And with no flying car 
available you decided that bursting into the Great 
Hall halfway through the feast ought to create a 
dramatic effect.” 

Still Harry remained silent, though he thought his 
chest might explode. He knew that Snape had come 
to fetch him for this, for the few minutes when he 
could needle and torment Harry without anyone else 
listening. 

They reached the castle steps at last and as the great 
oaken front doors swung open into the vast flagged 
entrance hall, a burst of talk and laughter and of 
tinkling plates and glasses greeted them through the 
doors standing open into the Great Hall. Harry 
wondered whether he could slip his Invisibility Cloak 
back on, thereby gaining his seat at the long 
Gryffindor table (which, inconveniently, was the 
farthest from the entrance hall) without being noticed. 
As though he had read Harry’s mind, however, Snape 
said, “No cloak. You can walk in so that everyone sees 
you, which is what you wanted, I’m sure.” 

Harry turned on the spot and marched straight 
through the open doors: anything to get away from 

Page | 180 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Snape. The Great Hall, with its four long House tables 
and its staff table set at the top of the room, was 
decorated as usual with floating candles that made 
the plates below glitter and glow. It was all a 
shimmering blur to Harry, however, who walked so 
fast that he was passing the Hufflepuff table before 
people really started to stare, and by the time they 
were standing up to get a good look at him, he had 
spotted Ron and Hermione, sped along the benches 
toward them, and forced his way in between them. 

“Where’ve you — blimey, what’ve you done to your 
face?” said Ron, goggling at him along with everyone 
else in the vicinity. 

“Why, what’s wrong with it?” said Harry, grabbing a 
spoon and squinting at his distorted reflection. 

“You’re covered in blood!” said Hermione. “Come here 



She raised her wand, said “Tergeol” and siphoned off 
the dried blood. 

“Thanks,” said Harry, feeling his now clean face. 
“How’s my nose looking?” 

“Normal,” said Hermione anxiously. “Why shouldn’t 
it? Harry, what happened? We’ve been terrified!” 

“I’ll tell you later,” said Harry curtly. He was very 
conscious that Ginny, Neville, Dean, and Seamus 
were listening in; even Nearly Headless Nick, the 
Gryffindor ghost, had come floating along the bench 
to eavesdrop. 

“But — ” said Hermione. 



Page | 181 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Not now, Hermione,” said Harry, in a darkly 
significant voice. He hoped very much that they would 
all assume he had been involved in something heroic, 
preferably involving a couple of Death Eaters and a 
dementor. Of course, Malfoy would spread the story 
as far and wide as he could, but there was always a 
chance it wouldn’t reach too many Gryffindor ears. 

He reached across Ron for a couple of chicken legs 
and a handful of chips, but before he could take them 
they vanished, to be replaced with puddings. 

“You missed the Sorting, anyway,” said Hermione, as 
Ron dived for a large chocolate gateau. 

“Hat say anything interesting?” asked Harry, taking a 
piece of treacle tart. 

“More of the same, really ... advising us all to unite in 
the face of our enemies, you know.” 

“Dumbledore mentioned Voldemort at all?” 

“Not yet, but he always saves his proper speech for 
after the feast, doesn’t he? It can’t be long now.” 

“Snape said Hagrid was late for the feast — ” 

“You’ve seen Snape? How come?” said Ron between 
frenzied mouthfuls of gateau. 

“Bumped into him,” said Harry evasively. 

“Hagrid was only a few minutes late,” said Hermione. 
“Look, he’s waving at you, Harry.” 

Harry looked up at the staff table and grinned at 
Hagrid, who was indeed waving at him. Hagrid had 
never quite managed to comport himself with the 

Page | 182 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




dignity of Professor McGonagall, Head of Gryffindor 
House, the top of whose head came up to somewhere 
between Hagrid’s elbow and shoulder as they were 
sitting side by side, and who was looking 
disapprovingly at this enthusiastic greeting. Harry 
was surprised to see the Divination teacher, Professor 
Trelawney, sitting on Hagrid’s other side; she rarely 
left her tower room, and he had never seen her at the 
start-of-term feast before. She looked as odd as ever, 
glittering with beads and trailing shawls, her eyes 
magnified to enormous size by her spectacles. Having 
always considered her a bit of a fraud, Harry had 
been shocked to discover at the end of the previous 
term that it had been she who had made the 
prediction that caused Lord Voldemort to kill Harry’s 
parents and attack Harry himself. The knowledge had 
made him even less eager to find himself in her 
company, but thankfully, this year he would be 
dropping Divination. Her great beaconlike eyes 
swiveled in his direction; he hastily looked away 
toward the Slytherin table. Draco Malfoy was miming 
the shattering of a nose to raucous laughter and 
applause. Harry dropped his gaze to his treacle tart, 
his insides burning again. What he would not give to 
fight Malfoy one-on-one . . . 

“So what did Professor Slughorn want?” Hermione 
asked. 

“To know what really happened at the Ministry,” said 
Harry. 

“Him and everyone else here,” sniffed Hermione. 
“People were interrogating us about it on the train, 
weren’t they, Ron?” 

“Yeah,” said Ron. “All wanting to know if you really 
are ‘the Chosen One’ — ” 



Page | 183 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“There has been much talk on that very subject even 
amongst the ghosts,” interrupted Nearly Headless 
Nick, inclining his barely connected head toward 
Harry so that it wobbled dangerously on its ruff. “I am 
considered something of a Potter authority; it is 
widely known that we are friendly. I have assured the 
spirit community that I will not pester you for 
information, however. ‘Harry Potter knows that he 
can confide in me with complete confidence/ I told 
them. ‘I would rather die than betray his trust.’ ” 

“That’s not saying much, seeing as you’re already 
dead,” Ron observed. 

“Once again, you show all the sensitivity of a blunt 
axe,” said Nearly Headless Nick in affronted tones, 
and he rose into the air and glided back toward the 
far end of the Gryffindor table just as Dumbledore got 
to his feet at the staff table. The talk and laughter 
echoing around the Hall died away almost instantly. 

“The very best of evenings to you!” he said, smiling 
broadly, his arms opened wide as though to embrace 
the whole room. 

“What happened to his hand?” gasped Hermione. 

She was not the only one who had noticed. 
Dumbledore ’s right hand was as blackened and dead- 
looking as it had been on the night he had come to 
fetch Harry from the Dursleys. Whispers swept the 
room; Dumbledore, interpreting them correctly, 
merely smiled and shook his purple-and-gold sleeve 
over his injury. 

“Nothing to worry about,” he said airily. “Now ... to 
our new students, welcome, to our old students, 
welcome back! Another year full of magical education 
awaits you ...” 

Page | 184 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“His hand was like that when I saw him over the 
summer,” Harry whispered to Hermione. “I thought 
he’d have cured it by now, though ... or Madam 
Pomfrey would’ve done.” 

“It looks as if it’s died,” said Hermione, with a 
nauseated expression. “But there are some injuries 
you can’t cure ... old curses ... and there are poisons 
without antidotes. ...” 

"... and Mr. Filch, our caretaker, has asked me to say 
that there is a blanket ban on any joke items bought 
at the shop called Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes. 

“Those wishing to play for their House Quidditch 
teams should give their names to their Heads of 
House as usual. We are also looking for new 
Quidditch commentators, who should do likewise. 

“We are pleased to welcome a new member of staff 
this year. Professor Slughorn” — Slughorn stood up, 
his bald head gleaming in the candlelight, his big 
waistcoated belly casting the table below into shadow 
— “is a former colleague of mine who has agreed to 
resume his old post of Potions master.” 

“Potions?” 

“Potions?” 

The word echoed all over the Hall as people wondered 
whether they had heard right. 

“Potions?” said Ron and Hermione together, turning 
to stare at Harry. “But you said — ” 

“Professor Snape, meanwhile,” said Dumbledore, 
raising his voice so that it carried over all the 



Page | 185 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




muttering, “will be taking over the position of Defense 
Against the Dark Arts teacher.” 



“No!” said Harry, so loudly that many heads turned in 
his direction. He did not care; he was staring up at 
the staff table, incensed. How could Snape be given 
the Defense Against the Dark Arts job after all this 
time? Hadn’t it been widely known for years that 
Dumbledore did not trust him to do it? 

“But Harry, you said that Slughorn was going to be 
teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts!” said 
Hermione. 

“I thought he was!” said Harry, racking his brains to 
remember when Dumbledore had told him this, but 
now that he came to think of it, he was unable to 
recall Dumbledore ever telling him what Slughorn 
would be teaching. 

Snape, who was sitting on Dumbledore’s right, did 
not stand up at the mention of his name; he merely 
raised a hand in lazy acknowledgment of the applause 
from the Slytherin table, yet Harry was sure he could 
detect a look of triumph on the features he loathed so 
much. 

“Well, there’s one good thing,” he said savagely. 

“Snape ’ll be gone by the end of the year.” 

“What do you mean?” asked Ron. 

“That job’s jinxed. No one’s lasted more than a year. 

... Quirrell actually died doing it. ... Personally, I’m 
going to keep my fingers crossed for another death. 



“Harry!” said Hermione, shocked and reproachful. 

Page | 186 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“He might just go back to teaching Potions at the end 
of the year,” said Ron reasonably. “That Slughorn 
bloke might not want to stay long-term. Moody 
didn’t.” 

Dumbledore cleared his throat. Harry, Ron, and 
Hermione were not the only ones who had been 
talking; the whole Hall had erupted in a buzz of 
conversation at the news that Snape had finally 
achieved his heart’s desire. Seemingly oblivious to the 
sensational nature of the news he had just imparted, 
Dumbledore said nothing more about staff 
appointments, but waited a few seconds to ensure 
that the silence was absolute before continuing. 

“Now, as everybody in this Hall knows, Lord 
Voldemort and his followers are once more at large 
and gaining in strength.” 

The silence seemed to tauten and strain as 
Dumbledore spoke. Harry glanced at Malfoy. Malfoy 
was not looking at Dumbledore, but making his fork 
hover in midair with his wand, as though he found 
the headmaster’s words unworthy of his attention. 

“I cannot emphasize strongly enough how dangerous 
the present situation is, and how much care each of 
us at Hogwarts must take to ensure that we remain 
safe. The castle’s magical fortifications have been 
strengthened over the summer, we are protected in 
new and more powerful ways, but we must still guard 
scrupulously against carelessness on the part of any 
student or member of staff. I urge you, therefore, to 
abide by any security restrictions that your teachers 
might impose upon you, however irksome you might 
find them — in particular, the rule that you are not to 
be out of bed after hours. I implore you, should you 
notice anything strange or suspicious within or 
outside the castle, to report it to a member of staff 
Page | 187 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




immediately. I trust you to conduct yourselves, 
always, with the utmost regard for your own and 
others’ safety.” 

Dumbledore’s blue eyes swept over the students 
before he smiled once more. 

“But now, your beds await, as warm and comfortable 
as you could possibly wish, and I know that your top 
priority is to be well-rested for your lessons tomorrow. 
Let us therefore say good night. Pip pip!” 

With the usual deafening scraping noise, the benches 
were moved back and the hundreds of students began 
to file out of the Great Hall toward their dormitories. 
Harry, who was in no hurry at all to leave with the 
gawping crowd, nor to get near enough to Malfoy to 
allow him to retell the story of the nose-stamping, 
lagged behind, pretending to retie the lace on his 
trainer, allowing most of the Gryffindors to draw 
ahead of him. Hermione had darted ahead to fulfill 
her prefect’s duty of shepherding the first years, but 
Ron remained with Harry. 

“What really happened to your nose?” he asked, once 
they were at the very back of the throng pressing out 
of the Hall, and out of earshot of anyone else. 

Harry told him. It was a mark of the strength of their 
friendship that Ron did not laugh. 

“I saw Malfoy miming something to do with a nose,” 
he said darkly. 

“Yeah, well, never mind that,” said Harry bitterly. 
“Listen to what he was saying before he found out I 
was there. ...” 



Page | 188 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Harry had expected Ron to be stunned by Malfoy’s 
boasts. With what Harry considered pure 
pigheadedness, however, Ron was unimpressed. 

“Come on, Harry, he was just showing off for 
Parkinson. ... What kind of mission would You-Know- 
Who have given him?” 

“How d’you know Voldemort doesn’t need someone at 
Hogwarts? It wouldn’t be the first — ” 

“I wish yeh’d stop sayin’ tha’ name, Harry,” said a 
reproachful voice behind them. Harry looked over his 
shoulder to see Hagrid shaking his head. 

“Dumbledore uses that name,” said Harry stubbornly. 

“Yeah, well, tha’s Dumbledore, innit?” said Hagrid 
mysteriously. “So how come yeh were late, Harry? I 
was worried.” 

“Got held up on the train,” said Harry. “Why were you 
late?” 

“I was with Grawp,” said Hagrid happily. “Los’ track o’ 
the time. He’s got a new home up in the mountains 
now, Dumbledore fixed it — nice big cave. He’s much 
happier than he was in the forest. We were havin’ a 
good chat.” 

“Really?” said Harry, taking care not to catch Ron’s 
eye; the last time he had met Hagrid’s half-brother, a 
vicious giant with a talent for ripping up trees by the 
roots, his vocabulary had comprised five words, two of 
which he was unable to pronounce properly. 

“Oh yeah, he’s really come on,” said Hagrid proudly. 
“Yeh’ll be amazed. I’m thinkin’ o’ trainin’ him up as 
me assistant.” 

Page | 189 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Ron snorted loudly, but managed to pass it off as a 
violent sneeze. They were now standing beside the 
oak front doors. 

“Anyway, I’ll see yeh tomorrow, firs’ lesson’s straight 
after lunch. Come early an’ yeh can say hello ter Buck 
— I mean, Witherwings!” 

Raising an arm in cheery farewell, he headed out of 
the front doors into the darkness. 

Harry and Ron looked at each other. Harry could tell 
that Ron was experiencing the same sinking feeling as 
himself. 

“You’re not taking Care of Magical Creatures, are 
you?” 

Ron shook his head. “And you’re not either, are you?” 

Harry shook his head too. 

“And Hermione,” said Ron, “she’s not, is she?” 

Harry shook his head again. Exactly what Hagrid 
would say when he realized his three favorite 
students had given up his subject, he did not like to 
think.

THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE 

Harry and Ron met Hermione in the common room 
before breakfast next morning. Hoping for some 
support for his theory, Harry lost no time in telling 
Hermione what he had overheard Malfoy saying on 
the Hogwarts Express. 

“But he was obviously showing off for Parkinson, 
wasn’t he?” interjected Ron quickly, before Hermione 
could say anything. 

“Well,” she said uncertainly, “I don’t know. ... It would 
be like Malfoy to make himself seem more important 
than he is ... but that’s a big lie to tell. ...” 

“Exactly,” said Harry, but he could not press the 
point, because so many people were trying to listen in 
to his conversation, not to mention staring at him and 
whispering behind their hands. 

“It’s rude to point,” Ron snapped at a particularly 
minuscule first-year boy as they joined the queue to 
climb out of the portrait hole. The boy, who had been 

Page | 191 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 



muttering something about Harry behind his hand to 
his friend, promptly turned scarlet and toppled out of 
the hole in alarm. Ron sniggered. 

“I love being a sixth year. And we’re going to be 
getting free time this year. Whole periods when we 
can just sit up here and relax.” 

“We’re going to need that time for studying, Ron!” said 
Hermione, as they set off down the corridor. 

“Yeah, but not today,” said Ron. “Today’s going to be 
a real doss, I reckon.” 

“Hold it!” said Hermione, throwing out an arm and 
halting a passing fourth year, who was attempting to 
push past her with a lime-green disk clutched tightly 
in his hand. “Fanged Frisbees are banned, hand it 
over,” she told him sternly. The scowling boy handed 
over the snarling Frisbee, ducked under her arm, and 
took off after his friends. Ron waited for him to 
vanish, then tugged the Frisbee from Hermione ’s grip. 

“Excellent, I’ve always wanted one of these.” 

Hermione ’s remonstration was drowned by a loud 
giggle; Lavender Brown had apparently found Ron’s 
remark highly amusing. She continued to laugh as 
she passed them, glancing back at Ron over her 
shoulder. Ron looked rather pleased with himself. 

The ceiling of the Great Hall was serenely blue and 
streaked with frail, wispy clouds, just like the squares 
of sky visible through the high mullioned windows. 
While they tucked into porridge and eggs and bacon, 
Harry and Ron told Hermione about their 
embarrassing conversation with Hagrid the previous 
evening. 



Page | 192 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“But he can’t really think we’d continue Care of 
Magical Creatures!” she said, looking distressed. “I 
mean, when has any of us expressed ... you know ... 
any enthusiasm?” 

“That’s it, though, innit?” said Ron, swallowing an 
entire fried egg whole. “We were the ones who made 
the most effort in classes because we like Hagrid. But 
he thinks we liked the stupid subject D’you reckon 
anyone’s going to go on to N.E.W.T.?” 

Neither Harry nor Hermione answered; there was no 
need. They knew perfectly well that nobody in their 
year would want to continue Care of Magical 
Creatures. They avoided Hagrid’s eye and returned 
his cheery wave only halfheartedly when he left the 
staff table ten minutes later. 

After they had eaten, they remained in their places, 
awaiting Professor McGonagall’s descent from the 
staff table. The distribution of class schedules was 
more complicated than usual this year, for Professor 
McGonagall needed first to confirm that everybody 
had achieved the necessary O.W.L. grades to continue 
with their chosen N.E.W.T.s. 

Hermione was immediately cleared to continue with 
Charms, Defense Against the Dark Arts, 
Transfiguration, Herbology, Arithmancy, Ancient 
Runes, and Potions, and shot off to a first-period 
Ancient Runes class without further ado. Neville took 
a little longer to sort out; his round face was anxious 
as Professor McGonagall looked down his application 
and then consulted his O.W.L. results. 

“Herbology, fine,” she said. “Professor Sprout will be 
delighted to see you back with an ‘Outstanding’ 

O.W.L. And you qualify for Defense Against the Dark 
Arts with ‘Exceeds Expectations.’ But the problem is 

Page | 193 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Transfiguration. I’m sorry, Longbottom, but an 
Acceptable’ really isn’t good enough to continue to 
N.E.W.T level. I just don’t think you’d be able to cope 
with the coursework.” 

Neville hung his head. Professor McGonagall peered 
at him through her square spectacles. 

“Why do you want to continue with Transfiguration, 
anyway? I’ve never had the impression that you 
particularly enjoyed it.” 

Neville looked miserable and muttered something 
about “my grandmother wants.” 

“Hmph,” snorted Professor McGonagall. “It’s high time 
your grandmother learned to be proud of the 
grandson she’s got, rather than the one she thinks 
she ought to have — particularly after what happened 
at the Ministry.” 

Neville turned very pink and blinked confusedly; 
Professor McGonagall had never paid him a 
compliment before. 

“I’m sorry, Longbottom, but I cannot let you into my 
N.E.W.T. class. I see that you have an ‘Exceeds 
Expectations’ in Charms, however — why not try for a 
N.E.W.T. in Charms?” 

“My grandmother thinks Charms is a soft option,” 
mumbled Neville. 

“Take Charms,” said Professor McGonagall, “and I 
shall drop Augusta a line reminding her that just 
because she failed her Charms O.W.L., the subject is 
not necessarily worthless.” Smiling slightly at the look 
of delighted incredulity on Neville’s face, Professor 
McGonagall tapped a blank schedule with the tip of 
Page | 194 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




her wand and handed it, now carrying details of his 
new classes, to Neville. 

Professor McGonagall turned next to Parvati Patil, 
whose first question was whether Firenze, the 
handsome centaur, was still teaching Divination. 

“He and Professor Trelawney are dividing classes 
between them this year,” said Professor McGonagall, 
a hint of disapproval in her voice; it was common 
knowledge that she despised the subject of 
Divination. “The sixth year is being taken by Professor 
Trelawney.” 

Parvati set off for Divination five minutes later looking 
slightly crestfallen. 

“So, Potter, Potter ...” said Professor McGonagall, 
consulting her notes as she turned to Harry. 

“Charms, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Herbology, 
Transfiguration ... all fine. I must say, I was pleased 
with your Transfiguration mark, Potter, very pleased. 
Now, why haven’t you applied to continue with 
Potions? I thought it was your ambition to become an 
Auror?” 

“It was, but you told me I had to get an ‘Outstanding’ 
in my O.W.L., Professor.” 

“And so you did when Professor Snape was teaching 
the subject. Professor Slughorn, however, is perfectly 
happy to accept N.E.W.T students with ‘Exceeds 
Expectations’ at O.W.L. Do you wish to proceed with 
Potions?” 

“Yes,” said Harry, “but I didn’t buy the books or any 
ingredients or anything — ” 



Page | 195 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“I’m sure Professor Slughorn will be able to lend you 
some,” said Professor McGonagall. “Very well, Potter, 
here is your schedule. Oh, by the way — twenty 
hopefuls have already put down their names for the 
Gryffindor Quidditch team. I shall pass the list to you 
in due course and you can fix up trials at your 
leisure.” 

A few minutes later, Ron was cleared to do the same 
subjects as Harry, and the two of them left the table 
together. 

“Look,” said Ron delightedly, gazing at his schedule, 
“we’ve got a free period now ... and a free period after 
break ... and after lunch ... excellent.” 

They returned to the common room, which was empty 
apart from a half dozen seventh years, including Katie 
Bell, the only remaining member of the original 
Gryffindor Quidditch team that Harry had joined in 
his first year. 

“I thought you’d get that, well done,” she called over, 
pointing at the Captain’s badge on Harry’s chest. “Tell 
me when you call trials!” 

“Don’t be stupid,” said Harry, “you don’t need to try 
out, I’ve watched you play for five years. ...” 

“You mustn’t start off like that,” she said warningly. 
“For all you know, there’s someone much better than 
me out there. Good teams have been ruined before 
now because Captains just kept playing the old faces, 
or letting in their friends. ...” 

Ron looked a little uncomfortable and began playing 
with the Fanged Frisbee Hermione had taken from the 
fourth-year student. It zoomed around the common 
room, snarling and attempting to take bites of the 

Page | 196 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




tapestry. Crookshanks’s yellow eyes followed it and he 
hissed when it came too close. 

An hour later they reluctantly left the sunlit common 
room for the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom 
four floors below. Hermione was already queuing 
outside, carrying an armful of heavy books and 
looking put-upon. 

“We got so much homework for Runes,” she said 
anxiously, when Harry and Ron joined her. “A fifteen- 
inch essay, two translations, and I’ve got to read 
these by Wednesday!” 

“Shame,” yawned Ron. 

“You wait,” she said resentfully. “I bet Snape gives us 
loads.” 

The classroom door opened as she spoke, and Snape 
stepped into the corridor, his sallow face framed as 
ever by two curtains of greasy black hair. Silence fell 
over the queue immediately. 

“Inside,” he said. 

Harry looked around as they entered. Snape had 
imposed his personality upon the room already; it 
was gloomier than usual, as curtains had been drawn 
over the windows, and was lit by candlelight. New 
pictures adorned the walls, many of them showing 
people who appeared to be in pain, sporting grisly 
injuries or strangely contorted body parts. Nobody 
spoke as they settled down, looking around at the 
shadowy, gruesome pictures. 

“I have not asked you to take out your books,” said 
Snape, closing the door and moving to face the class 
from behind his desk; Hermione hastily dropped her 

Page | 197 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




copy of Confronting the Faceless back into her bag 
and stowed it under her chair. “I wish to speak to 
you, and I want your fullest attention.” 

His black eyes roved over their upturned faces, 
lingering for a fraction of a second longer on Harry’s 
than anyone else’s. 

“You have had five teachers in this subject so far, I 
believe.” 

You believe ... like you haven’t watched them all come 
and go, Snape, hoping you’d be next, thought Harry 
scathingly. 

“Naturally, these teachers will all have had their own 
methods and priorities. Given this confusion I am 
surprised so many of you scraped an O.W.L. in this 
subject. I shall be even more surprised if all of you 
manage to keep up with the N.E.W.T. work, which will 
be much more advanced.” 

Snape set off around the edge of the room, speaking 
now in a lower voice; the class craned their necks to 
keep him in view. 

“The Dark Arts,” said Snape, “are many, varied, ever- 
changing, and eternal. Fighting them is like fighting a 
many-headed monster, which, each time a neck is 
severed, sprouts a head even fiercer and cleverer than 
before. You are fighting that which is unfixed, 
mutating, indestructible.” 

Harry stared at Snape. It was surely one thing to 
respect the Dark Arts as a dangerous enemy, another 
to speak of them, as Snape was doing, with a loving 
caress in his voice? 



Page | 198 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Your defenses,” said Snape, a little louder, “must 
therefore be as flexible and inventive as the arts you 
seek to undo. These pictures” — he indicated a few of 
them as he swept past — “give a fair representation of 
what happens to those who suffer, for instance, the 
Cruciatus Curse” — he waved a hand toward a witch 
who was clearly shrieking in agony — “feel the 
Dementor’s Kiss” — a wizard lying huddled and 
blank-eyed, slumped against a wall — “or provoke the 
aggression of the Inferius” — a bloody mass upon the 
ground. 

“Has an Inferius been seen, then?” said Parvati Patil 
in a high-pitched voice. “Is it definite, is he using 
them?” 

“The Dark Lord has used Inferi in the past,” said 
Snape, “which means you would be well-advised to 
assume he might use them again. Now ...” 

He set off again around the other side of the 
classroom toward his desk, and again, they watched 
him as he walked, his dark robes billowing behind 
him. 

"... you are, I believe, complete novices in the use of 
nonverbal spells. What is the advantage of a 
nonverbal spell?” 

Hermione’s hand shot into the air. Snape took his 
time looking around at everybody else, making sure 
he had no choice, before saying curtly, “Very well — 
Miss Granger?” 

“Your adversary has no warning about what kind of 
magic you’re about to perform,” said Hermione, 

“which gives you a split-second advantage.” 



Page | 199 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“An answer copied almost word for word from The 
Standard Book of Spells, Grade Six,” said Snape 
dismissively (over in the corner, Malfoy sniggered), 
“but correct in essentials. Yes, those who progress to 
using magic without shouting incantations gain an 
element of surprise in their spell-casting. Not all 
wizards can do this, of course; it is a question of 
concentration and mind power which some” — his 
gaze lingered maliciously upon Harry once more — 
“lack.” 

Harry knew Snape was thinking of their disastrous 
Occlumency lessons of the previous year. He refused 
to drop his gaze, but glowered at Snape until Snape 
looked away. 

“You will now divide,” Snape went on, “into pairs. One 
partner will attempt to jinx the other without 
speaking. The other will attempt to repel the jinx in 
equal silence. Carry on.” 

Although Snape did not know it, Harry had taught at 
least half the class (everyone who had been a member 
of the D.A.) how to perform a Shield Charm the 
previous year. None of them had ever cast the charm 
without speaking, however. A reasonable amount of 
cheating ensued; many people were merely 
whispering the incantation instead of saying it aloud. 
Typically, ten minutes into the lesson Hermione 
managed to repel Neville’s muttered Jelly-Legs Jinx 
without uttering a single word, a feat that would 
surely have earned her twenty points for Gryffindor 
from any reasonable teacher, thought Harry bitterly, 
but which Snape ignored. He swept between them as 
they practiced, looking just as much like an 
overgrown bat as ever, lingering to watch Harry and 
Ron struggling with the task. 



Page | 200 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Ron, who was supposed to be jinxing Harry, was 
purple in the face, his lips tightly compressed to save 
himself from the temptation of muttering the 
incantation. Harry had his wand raised, waiting on 
tenterhooks to repel a jinx that seemed unlikely ever 
to come. 

“Pathetic, Weasley,” said Snape, after a while. “Here 
— let me show you — ” 

He turned his wand on Harry so fast that Harry 
reacted instinctively; all thought of nonverbal spells 
forgotten, he yelled, “Protegol” 

His Shield Charm was so strong Snape was knocked 
off-balance and hit a desk. The whole class had 
looked around and now watched as Snape righted 
himself, scowling. 

“Do you remember me telling you we are practicing 
nonverbal spells, Potter?” 

“Yes,” said Harry stiffly. 

“Yes, sir.” 

“There’s no need to call me ‘sir,’ Professor.” 

The words had escaped him before he knew what he 
was saying. Several people gasped, including 
Hermione. Behind Snape, however, Ron, Dean, and 
Seamus grinned appreciatively. 

“Detention, Saturday night, my office,” said Snape. “I 
do not take cheek from anyone, Potter ... not even ‘the 
Chosen One. ’ ” 

“That was brilliant, Harry!” chortled Ron, once they 
were safely on their way to break a short while later. 

Page | 201 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling 




“You really shouldn’t have said it,” said Hermione, 
frowning at Ron. “What made you?” 



“He tried to jinx me, in case you didn’t notice!” fumed 
Harry. “I had enough of that during those 
Occlumency lessons! Why doesn’t he use another 
guinea pig for a change? What’s Dumbledore playing 
at, anyway, letting him teach Defense? Did you hear 
him talking about the Dark Arts? He loves them! All 
that unfixed, indestructible stuff — ” 

“Well,” said Hermione, “I thought he sounded a bit 
like you.” 

“Like me?” 

“Yes, when you were telling us what it’s like to face 
Voldemort. You said it wasn’t just memorizing a 
bunch of spells, you said it was just you and your 
brains and your guts — well, wasn’t that what Snape 
was saying? That it really comes down to being brave 
and quick-thinking?” 

Harry was so disarmed that she had thought his 
words as well worth memorizing as The Standard 
Book of Spells that he did not argue. 

“Harry! Hey, Harry!” 

Harry looked around; Jack Sloper, one of the Beaters 
on last year’s Gryffindor Quidditch team, was 
hurrying toward him holding a roll of parchment. 

“For you,” panted Sloper. “Listen, I heard you’re the 
new Captain. When’re you holding trials?” 

“I’m not sure yet,” said Harry, thinking privately that 
Sloper would be very lucky to get back on the team. 
“I’ll let you know.” 

Page | 202 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Oh, right. I was hoping it’d be this weekend — ” 



But Harry was not listening; he had just recognized 
the thin, slanting writing on the parchment. Leaving 
Sloper in mid-sentence, he hurried away with Ron 
and Hermione, unrolling the parchment as he went. 

Dear Harry, 

I would like to start our private lessons this Saturday. 
Kindly come along to my office at 8 p.m. I hope you are 
enjoying your first day back at school. 

Yours sincerely, 

Albus Dumbledore 

P. S. I enjoy Acid Pops. 

“He enjoys Acid Pops?” said Ron, who had read the 
message over Harry’s shoulder and was looking 
perplexed. 

“It’s the password to get past the gargoyle outside his 
study,” said Harry in a low voice. “Ha! Snape’s not 
going to be pleased. ... I won’t be able to do his 
detention!” 

He, Ron, and Hermione spent the whole of break 
speculating on what Dumbledore would teach Harry. 
Ron thought it most likely to be spectacular jinxes 
and hexes of the type the Death Eaters would not 
know. Hermione said such things were illegal, and 
thought it much more likely that Dumbledore wanted 
to teach Harry advanced Defensive magic. After 
break, she went off to Arithmancy while Harry and 
Ron returned to the common room, where they 
grudgingly started Snape’s homework. This turned 
out to be so complex that they still had not finished 
Page | 203 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




when Hermione joined them for their after-lunch free 
period (though she considerably speeded up the 
process). They had only just finished when the bell 
rang for the afternoon’s double Potions and they beat 
the familiar path down to the dungeon classroom that 
had, for so long, been Snape’s. 

When they arrived in the corridor they saw that there 
were only a dozen people progressing to N.E.W.T. 
level. Crabbe and Goyle had evidently failed to achieve 
the required O.W.L. grade, but four Slytherins had 
made it through, including Malfoy. Four Ravenclaws 
were there, and one Hufflepuff, Ernie Macmillan, 
whom Harry liked despite his rather pompous 
manner. 

“Harry,” Ernie said portentously, holding out his hand 
as Harry approached, “didn’t get a chance to speak in 
Defense Against the Dark Arts this morning. Good 
lesson, I thought, but Shield Charms are old hat, of 
course, for us old D.A. lags ... And how are you, Ron 
— Hermione?” 

Before they could say more than “fine,” the dungeon 
door opened and Slughorn’s belly preceded him out of 
the door. As they filed into the room, his great walrus 
mustache curved above his beaming mouth, and he 
greeted Harry and Zabini with particular enthusiasm. 

The dungeon was, most unusually, already full of 
vapors and odd smells. Harry, Ron, and Hermione 
sniffed interestedly as they passed large, bubbling 
cauldrons. The four Slytherins took a table together, 
as did the four Ravenclaws. This left Harry, Ron, and 
Hermione to share a table with Ernie. They chose the 
one nearest a gold-colored cauldron that was emitting 
one of the most seductive scents Harry had ever 
inhaled: Somehow it reminded him simultaneously of 
treacle tart, the woody smell of a broomstick handle, 
Page | 204 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




and something flowery he thought he might have 
smelled at the Burrow. He found that he was 
breathing very slowly and deeply and that the potion’s 
fumes seemed to be filling him up like drink. A great 
contentment stole over him; he grinned across at Ron, 
who grinned back lazily. 

“Now then, now then, now then,” said Slughorn, 
whose massive outline was quivering through the 
many shimmering vapors. “Scales out, everyone, and 
potion kits, and don’t forget your copies of Advanced 
Potion-Making. ...” 

“Sir?” said Harry, raising his hand. 

“Harry, m’boy?” 

“I haven’t got a book or scales or anything — nor’s 
Ron — we didn’t realize we’d be able to do the 
N.E.W.T., you see — ” 

“Ah, yes, Professor McGonagall did mention ... not to 
worry, my dear boy, not to worry at all. You can use 
ingredients from the store cupboard today, and I’m 
sure we can lend you some scales, and we’ve got a 
small stock of old books here, they’ll do until you can 
write to Flourish and Blotts. ...” 

Slughorn strode over to a corner cupboard and, after 
a moment’s foraging, emerged with two very battered- 
looking copies of Advanced Potion-Making by Libatius 
Borage, which he gave to Harry and Ron along with 
two sets of tarnished scales. 

“Now then,” said Slughorn, returning to the front of 
the class and inflating his already bulging chest so 
that the buttons on his waistcoat threatened to burst 
off, “I’ve prepared a few potions for you to have a look 
at, just out of interest, you know. These are the kind 
Page | 205 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




of thing you ought to be able to make after completing 
your N.E.W.T.s. You ought to have heard of ’em, even 
if you haven’t made ’em yet. Anyone tell me what this 
one is?” 

He indicated the cauldron nearest the Slytherin table. 
Harry raised himself slightly in his seat and saw what 
looked like plain water boiling away inside it. 

Hermione’s well-practiced hand hit the air before 
anybody else’s; Slughorn pointed at her. 

“It’s Veritaserum, a colorless, odorless potion that 
forces the drinker to tell the truth,” said Hermione. 

“Very good, very good!” said Slughorn happily. “Now,” 
he continued, pointing at the cauldron nearest the 
Ravenclaw table, “this one here is pretty well known. 
... Featured in a few Ministry leaflets lately too ... Who 
can — ?” 

Hermione’s hand was fastest once more. 

“It’s Polyjuice Potion, sir,” she said. 

Harry too had recognized the slow-bubbling, mudlike 
substance in the second cauldron, but did not resent 
Hermione getting the credit for answering the 
question; she, after all, was the one who had 
succeeded in making it, back in their second year. 

“Excellent, excellent! Now, this one here ... yes, my 
dear?” said Slughorn, now looking slightly bemused, 
as Hermione’s hand punched the air again. 

“It’s Amortentia!” 



Page | 206 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“It is indeed. It seems almost foolish to ask,” said 
Slughorn, who was looking mightily impressed, “but I 
assume you know what it does?” 

“It’s the most powerful love potion in the world!” said 
Hermione. 

“Quite right! You recognized it, I suppose, by its 
distinctive mother-of-pearl sheen?” 

“And the steam rising in characteristic spirals,” said 
Hermione enthusiastically, “and it’s supposed to 
smell differently to each of us, according to what 
attracts us, and I can smell freshly mown grass and 
new parchment and — ” 

But she turned slightly pink and did not complete the 
sentence. 

“May I ask your name, my dear?” said Slughorn, 
ignoring Hermione’s embarrassment. 

“Hermione Granger, sir.” 

“Granger? Granger? Can you possibly be related to 
Hector Dagworth-Granger, who founded the Most 
Extraordinary Society of Potioneers?” 

“No, I don’t think so, sir. I’m Muggle-born, you see.” 

Harry saw Malfoy lean close to Nott and whisper 
something; both of them sniggered, but Slughorn 
showed no dismay; on the contrary, he beamed and 
looked from Hermione to Harry, who was sitting next 
to her. 

“Oho! ‘One of my best friends is Muggle-born, and 
she’s the best in our yeah’ I’m assuming this is the 
very friend of whom you spoke, Harry?” 

Page | 207 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Yes, sir,” said Harry. 



“Well, well, take twenty well-earned points for 
Gryffindor, Miss Granger,” said Slughorn genially. 

Malfoy looked rather as he had done the time 
Hermione had punched him in the face. Hermione 
turned to Harry with a radiant expression and 
whispered, “Did you really tell him I’m the best in the 
year? Oh, Harry!” 

“Well, what’s so impressive about that?” whispered 
Ron, who for some reason looked annoyed. “You are 
the best in the year — I’d’ve told him so if he’d asked 
me!” 

Hermione smiled but made a “shhing” gesture, so that 
they could hear what Slughorn was saying. Ron 
looked slightly disgruntled. 

“Amortentia doesn’t really create love, of course. It is 
impossible to manufacture or imitate love. No, this 
will simply cause a powerful infatuation or obsession. 
It is probably the most dangerous and powerful 
potion in this room — oh yes,” he said, nodding 
gravely at Malfoy and Nott, both of whom were 
smirking skeptically. “When you have seen as much 
of life as I have, you will not underestimate the power 
of obsessive love. ... 

“And now,” said Slughorn, “it is time for us to start 
work.” 

“Sir, you haven’t told us what’s in this one,” said 
Ernie Macmillan, pointing at a small black cauldron 
standing on Slughorn ’s desk. The potion within was 
splashing about merrily; it was the color of molten 
gold, and large drops were leaping like goldfish above 
the surface, though not a particle had spilled. 

Page | 208 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Oho,” said Slughorn again. Harry was sure that 
Slughorn had not forgotten the potion at all, but had 
waited to be asked for dramatic effect. “Yes. That. 
Well, that one, ladies and gentlemen, is a most 
curious little potion called Felix Felicis. I take it,” he 
turned, smiling, to look at Hermione, who had let out 
an audible gasp, “that you know what Felix Felicis 
does, Miss Granger?” 

“It’s liquid luck,” said Hermione excitedly. “It makes 
you lucky!” 

The whole class seemed to sit up a little straighter. 
Now all Harry could see of Malfoy was the back of his 
sleek blond head, because he was at last giving 
Slughorn his full and undivided attention. 

“Quite right, take another ten points for Gryffindor. 
Yes, it’s a funny little potion, Felix Felicis,” said 
Slughorn. “Desperately tricky to make, and 
disastrous to get wrong. However, if brewed correctly, 
as this has been, you will find that all your endeavors 
tend to succeed ... at least until the effects wear off.” 

“Why don’t people drink it all the time, sir?” said 
Terry Boot eagerly. 

“Because if taken in excess, it causes giddiness, 
recklessness, and dangerous overconfidence,” said 
Slughorn. “Too much of a good thing, you know ... 
highly toxic in large quantities. But taken sparingly, 
and very occasionally ...” 

“Have you ever taken it, sir?” asked Michael Corner 
with great interest. 

“Twice in my life,” said Slughorn. “Once when I was 
twenty-four, once when I was fifty-seven. Two 



Page | 209 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




tablespoonfuls taken with breakfast. Two perfect 
days.” 

He gazed dreamily into the distance. Whether he was 
playacting or not, thought Harry, the effect was good. 

“And that,” said Slughorn, apparently coming back to 
earth, “is what I shall be offering as a prize in this 
lesson.” 

There was silence in which every bubble and gurgle of 
the surrounding potions seemed magnified tenfold. 

“One tiny bottle of Felix Felicis,” said Slughorn, taking 
a minuscule glass bottle with a cork in it out of his 
pocket and showing it to them all. “Enough for twelve 
hours’ luck. From dawn till dusk, you will be lucky in 
everything you attempt. 

“Now, I must give you warning that Felix Felicis is a 
banned substance in organized competitions . . . 
sporting events, for instance, examinations, or 
elections. So the winner is to use it on an ordinary 
day only . . . and watch how that ordinary day becomes 
extraordinary! 

“So,” said Slughorn, suddenly brisk, “how are you to 
win my fabulous prize? Well, by turning to page ten of 
Advanced Potion-Making. We have a little over an hour 
left to us, which should be time for you to make a 
decent attempt at the Draught of Living Death. I know 
it is more complex than anything you have attempted 
before, and I do not expect a perfect potion from 
anybody. The person who does best, however, will win 
little Felix here. Off you go!” 

There was a scraping as everyone drew their 
cauldrons toward them and some loud clunks as 
people began adding weights to their scales, but 

Page | 210 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling 




nobody spoke. The concentration within the room was 
almost tangible. Harry saw Malfoy riffling feverishly 
through his copy of Advanced Potion-Making. It could 
not have been clearer that Malfoy really wanted that 
lucky day. Harry bent swiftly over the tattered book 
Slughorn had lent him. 

To his annoyance he saw that the previous owner had 
scribbled all over the pages, so that the margins were 
as black as the printed portions. Bending low to 
decipher the ingredients (even here, the previous 
owner had made annotations and crossed things out) 
Harry hurried off toward the store cupboard to find 
what he needed. As he dashed back to his cauldron, 
he saw Malfoy cutting up valerian roots as fast as he 
could. 

Everyone kept glancing around at what the rest of the 
class was doing; this was both an advantage and a 
disadvantage of Potions, that it was hard to keep your 
work private. Within ten minutes, the whole place 
was full of bluish steam. Hermione, of course, seemed 
to have progressed furthest. Her potion already 
resembled the “smooth, black currant-colored liquid” 
mentioned as the ideal halfway stage. 

Having finished chopping his roots, Harry bent low 
over his book again. It was really very irritating, 
having to try and decipher the directions under all the 
stupid scribbles of the previous owner, who for some 
reason had taken issue with the order to cut up the 
sopophorous bean and had written in the alternative 
instruction: 

Crush with flat side of silver dagger, 
releases juice better than cutting. 



Page | 211 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Sir, I think you knew my grandfather, Abraxas 
Malfoy?” 

Harry looked up; Slughorn was just passing the 
Slytherin table. 

“Yes,” said Slughorn, without looking at Malfoy, “I 
was sorry to hear he had died, although of course it 
wasn’t unexpected, dragon pox at his age. ...” 

And he walked away. Harry bent back over his 
cauldron, smirking. He could tell that Malfoy had 
expected to be treated like Harry or Zabini; perhaps 
even hoped for some preferential treatment of the type 
he had learned to expect from Snape. It looked as 
though Malfoy would have to rely on nothing but 
talent to win the bottle of Felix Felicis. 

The sopophorous bean was proving very difficult to 
cut up. Harry turned to Hermione. 

“Can I borrow your silver knife?” 

She nodded impatiently, not taking her eyes off her 
potion, which was still deep purple, though according 
to the book ought to be turning a light shade of lilac 
by now. 

Harry crushed his bean with the flat side of the 
dagger. To his astonishment, it immediately exuded 
so much juice he was amazed the shriveled bean 
could have held it all. Hastily scooping it all into the 
cauldron he saw, to his surprise, that the potion 
immediately turned exactly the shade of lilac 
described by the textbook. 

His annoyance with the previous owner vanishing on 
the spot, Harry now squinted at the next line of 
instructions. According to the book, he had to stir 

Page | 212 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




counterclockwise until the potion turned clear as 
water. According to the addition the previous owner 
had made, however, he ought to add a clockwise stir 
after every seventh counterclockwise stir. Could the 
old owner be right twice? 

Harry stirred counterclockwise, held his breath, and 
stirred once clockwise. The effect was immediate. The 
potion turned palest pink. 

“How are you doing that?” demanded Hermione, who 
was red-faced and whose hair was growing bushier 
and bushier in the fumes from her cauldron; her 
potion was still resolutely purple. 

“Add a clockwise stir — ” 

“No, no, the book says counterclockwise!” she 
snapped. 

Harry shrugged and continued what he was doing. 
Seven stirs counterclockwise, one clockwise, pause ... 
seven stirs counterclockwise, one stir clockwise ... 

Across the table, Ron was cursing fluently under his 
breath; his potion looked like liquid licorice. Harry 
glanced around. As far as he could see, no one else’s 
potion had turned as pale as his. He felt elated, 
something that had certainly never happened before 
in this dungeon. 

“And time’s ... up!” called Slughorn. “Stop stirring, 
please!” 

Slughorn moved slowly among the tables, peering into 
cauldrons. He made no comment, but occasionally 
gave the potions a stir or a sniff. At last he reached 
the table where Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ernie 
were sitting. He smiled ruefully at the tarlike 
Page | 213 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling 




substance in Ron’s cauldron. He passed over Ernie’s 
navy concoction. Hermione’s potion he gave an 
approving nod. Then he saw Harry’s, and a look of 
incredulous delight spread over his face. 

“The clear winner!” he cried to the dungeon. 

“Excellent, excellent, Harry! Good lord, it’s clear 
you’ve inherited your mother’s talent. She was a dab 
hand at Potions, Lily was! Here you are, then, here 
you are — one bottle of Felix Felicis, as promised, and 
use it well!” 

Harry slipped the tiny bottle of golden liquid into his 
inner pocket, feeling an odd combination of delight at 
the furious looks on the Slytherins’ faces and guilt at 
the disappointed expression on Hermione’s. Ron 
looked simply dumbfounded. 

“How did you do that?” he whispered to Harry as they 
left the dungeon. 

“Got lucky, I suppose,” said Harry, because Malfoy 
was within earshot. 

Once they were securely ensconced at the Gryffindor 
table for dinner, however, he felt safe enough to tell 
them. Hermione’s face became stonier with every 
word he uttered. 

“I s’pose you think I cheated?” he finished, aggravated 
by her expression. 

“Well, it wasn’t exactly your own work, was it?” she 
said stiffly. 

“He only followed different instructions to ours,” said 
Ron. “Could’ve been a catastrophe, couldn’t it? But he 
took a risk and it paid off.” He heaved a sigh. 
“Slughorn could’ve handed me that book, but no, I get 

Page | 214 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




the one no one’s ever written on. Puked on, by the 
look of page fifty-two, but — ” 

“Hang on,” said a voice close by Harry’s left ear and 
he caught a sudden waft of that flowery smell he had 
picked up in Slughorn’s dungeon. He looked around 
and saw that Ginny had joined them. “Did I hear 
right? You’ve been taking orders from something 
someone wrote in a book, Harry?” 

She looked alarmed and angry. Harry knew what was 
on her mind at once. 

“It’s nothing,” he said reassuringly, lowering his voice. 
“It’s not like, you know, Riddle’s diary. It’s just an old 
textbook someone’s scribbled on.” 

“But you’re doing what it says?” 

“I just tried a few of the tips written in the margins, 
honestly, Ginny, there’s nothing funny — ” 

“Ginny’s got a point,” said Hermione, perking up at 
once. “We ought to check that there’s nothing odd 
about it. I mean, all these funny instructions, who 
knows?” 

“Hey!” said Harry indignantly, as she pulled his copy 
of Advanced Potion-Making out of his bag and raised 
her wand. 

“ Specialis Revelio\” she said, rapping it smartly on the 
front cover. 

Nothing whatsoever happened. The book simply lay 
there, looking old and dirty and dog-eared. 

“Finished?” said Harry irritably. “Or d’you want to 
wait and see if it does a few backflips?” 

Page | 215 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“It seems all right,” said Hermione, still staring at the 
book suspiciously. “I mean, it really does seem to be 
... just a textbook.” 

“Good. Then I’ll have it back,” said Harry, snatching it 
off the table, but it slipped from his hand and landed 
open on the floor. 

Nobody else was looking. Harry bent low to retrieve 
the book, and as he did so, he saw something 
scribbled along the bottom of the back cover in the 
same small, cramped handwriting as the instructions 
that had won him his bottle of Felix Felicis, now 
safely hidden inside a pair of socks in his trunk 
upstairs. 

This Book is the Property of the Half-Blood Prince.

THE HOUSE OF GAUNT 

For the rest of the week’s Potions lessons Harry 
continued to follow the Half-Blood Prince’s 
instructions wherever they deviated from Libatius 
Borage’s, with the result that by their fourth lesson 
Slughorn was raving about Harry’s abilities, saying 
that he had rarely taught anyone so talented. Neither 
Ron nor Hermione was delighted by this. Although 
Harry had offered to share his book with both of 
them, Ron had more difficulty deciphering the 
handwriting than Harry did, and could not keep 
asking Harry to read aloud or it might look 
suspicious. Hermione, meanwhile, was resolutely 
plowing on with what she called the “official” 
instructions, but becoming increasingly bad-tempered 
as they yielded poorer results than the Prince’s. 

Harry wondered vaguely who the Half-Blood Prince 
had been. Although the amount of homework they 
had been given prevented him from reading the whole 
of his copy of Advanced Potion-Making, he had 
skimmed through it sufficiently to see that there was 

Page | 217 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




barely a page on which the Prince had not made 
additional notes, not all of them concerned with 
potion-making. Here and there were directions for 
what looked like spells that the Prince had made up 
himself. 

“Or herself,” said Hermione irritably, overhearing 
Harry pointing some of these out to Ron in the 
common room on Saturday evening. “It might have 
been a girl. I think the handwriting looks more like a 
girl’s than a boy’s.” 

“The Half-Blood Prince, he was called,” Harry said. 
“How many girls have been Princes?” 

Hermione seemed to have no answer to this. She 
merely scowled and twitched her essay on The 
Principles of Re materialization away from Ron, who 
was trying to read it upside down. 

Harry looked at his watch and hurriedly put the old 
copy of Advanced Potion-Making back into his bag. 

“It’s five to eight, I’d better go, I’ll be late for 
Dumbledore.” 

“Ooooh!” gasped Hermione, looking up at once. “Good 
luck! We’ll wait up, we want to hear what he teaches 
you!” 

“Hope it goes okay,” said Ron, and the pair of them 
watched Harry leave through the portrait hole. 

Harry proceeded through deserted corridors, though 
he had to step hastily behind a statue when Professor 
Trelawney appeared around a corner, muttering to 
herself as she shuffled a pack of dirty-looking playing 
cards, reading them as she walked. 



Page | 218 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Two of spades: conflict,” she murmured, as she 
passed the place where Harry crouched, hidden. 
“Seven of spades: an ill omen. Ten of spades: violence. 
Knave of spades: a dark young man, possibly 
troubled, one who dislikes the questioner — ” 

She stopped dead, right on the other side of Harry’s 
statue. 

“Well, that can’t be right,” she said, annoyed, and 
Harry heard her reshuffling vigorously as she set off 
again, leaving nothing but a whiff of cooking sherry 
behind her. Harry waited until he was quite sure she 
had gone, then hurried off again until he reached the 
spot in the seventh-floor corridor where a single 
gargoyle stood against the wall. 

“Acid Pops,” said Harry, and the gargoyle leapt aside; 
the wall behind it slid apart, and a moving spiral 
stone staircase was revealed, onto which Harry 
stepped, so that he was carried in smooth circles up 
to the door with the brass knocker that led to 
Dumbledore’s office. 

Harry knocked. 

“Come in,” said Dumbledore’s voice. 

“Good evening, sir,” said Harry, walking into the 
headmaster’s office. 

“Ah, good evening, Harry. Sit down,” said 
Dumbledore, smiling. “I hope you’ve had an enjoyable 
first week back at school?” 

“Yes, thanks, sir,” said Harry. 

“You must have been busy, a detention under your 
belt already!” 

Page | 219 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Er,” began Harry awkwardly, but Dumbledore did 
not look too stern. 

“I have arranged with Professor Snape that you will 
do your detention next Saturday instead.” 

“Right,” said Harry, who had more pressing matters 
on his mind than S nape’s detention, and now looked 
around surreptitiously for some indication of what 
Dumbledore was planning to do with him this 
evening. The circular office looked just as it always 
did; the delicate silver instruments stood on spindle- 
legged tables, puffing smoke and whirring; portraits of 
previous headmasters and headmistresses dozed in 
their frames, and Dumbledore’s magnificent phoenix, 
Fawkes, stood on his perch behind the door, watching 
Harry with bright interest. It did not even look as 
though Dumbledore had cleared a space for dueling 
practice. 

“So, Harry,” said Dumbledore, in a businesslike voice. 
“You have been wondering, I am sure, what I have 
planned for you during these — for want of a better 
word — lessons?” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“Well, I have decided that it is time, now that you 
know what prompted Lord Voldemort to try and kill 
you fifteen years ago, for you to be given certain 
information.” 

There was a pause. 

“You said, at the end of last term, you were going to 
tell me everything,” said Harry. It was hard to keep a 
note of accusation from his voice. “Sir,” he added. 



Page | 220 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“And so I did,” said Dumbledore placidly. “I told you 
everything I know. From this point forth, we shall be 
leaving the firm foundation of fact and journeying 
together through the murky marshes of memory into 
thickets of wildest guesswork. From here on in, 

Harry, I may be as woefully wrong as Humphrey 
Belcher, who believed the time was ripe for a cheese 
cauldron.” 

“But you think you’re right?” said Harry. 

“Naturally I do, but as I have already proven to you, I 
make mistakes like the next man. In fact, being — 
forgive me — rather cleverer than most men, my 
mistakes tend to be correspondingly huger.” 

“Sir,” said Harry tentatively, “does what you’re going 
to tell me have anything to do with the prophecy? Will 
it help me . . . survive?” 

“It has a very great deal to do with the prophecy,” said 
Dumbledore, as casually as if Harry had asked him 
about the next day’s weather, “and I certainly hope 
that it will help you to survive.” 

Dumbledore got to his feet and walked around the 
desk, past Harry, who turned eagerly in his seat to 
watch Dumbledore bending over the cabinet beside 
the door. When Dumbledore straightened up, he was 
holding a familiar shallow stone basin etched with 
odd markings around its rim. He placed the Pensieve 
on the desk in front of Harry. 

“You look worried.” 

Harry had indeed been eyeing the Pensieve with some 
apprehension. His previous experiences with the odd 
device that stored and revealed thoughts and 
memories, though highly instructive, had also been 

Page | 221 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




uncomfortable. The last time he had disturbed its 
contents, he had seen much more than he would 
have wished. But Dumbledore was smiling. 

“This time, you enter the Pensieve with me ... and, 
even more unusually, with permission.” 

“Where are we going, sir?” 

“For a trip down Bob Ogden’s memory lane,” said 
Dumbledore, pulling from his pocket a crystal bottle 
containing a swirling silvery- white substance. 

“Who was Bob Ogden?” 

“He was employed by the Department of Magical Law 
Enforcement,” said Dumbledore. “He died some time 
ago, but not before I had tracked him down and 
persuaded him to confide these recollections to me. 

We are about to accompany him on a visit he made in 
the course of his duties. If you will stand, Harry ...” 

But Dumbledore was having difficulty pulling out the 
stopper of the crystal bottle: His injured hand seemed 
stiff and painful. 

“Shall — shall I, sir?” 

“No matter, Harry — ” 

Dumbledore pointed his wand at the bottle and the 
cork flew out. 

“Sir — how did you injure your hand?” Harry asked 
again, looking at the blackened fingers with a mixture 
of revulsion and pity. 

“Now is not the moment for that story, Harry. Not yet. 
We have an appointment with Bob Ogden.” 

Page | 222 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Dumbledore tipped the silvery contents of the bottle 
into the Pensieve, where they swirled and shimmered, 
neither liquid nor gas. 

“After you,” said Dumbledore, gesturing toward the 
bowl. 

Harry bent forward, took a deep breath, and plunged 
his face into the silvery substance. He felt his feet 
leave the office floor; he was falling, falling through 
whirling darkness and then, quite suddenly, he was 
blinking in dazzling sunlight. Before his eyes had 
adjusted, Dumbledore landed beside him. 

They were standing in a country lane bordered by 
high, tangled hedgerows, beneath a summer sky as 
bright and blue as a forget-me-not. Some ten feet in 
front of them stood a short, plump man wearing 
enormously thick glasses that reduced his eyes to 
molelike specks. He was reading a wooden signpost 
that was sticking out of the brambles on the left-hand 
side of the road. Harry knew this must be Ogden; he 
was the only person in sight, and he was also wearing 
the strange assortment of clothes so often chosen by 
inexperienced wizards trying to look like Muggles: in 
this case, a frock coat and spats over a striped one- 
piece bathing costume. Before Harry had time to do 
more than register his bizarre appearance, however, 
Ogden had set off at a brisk walk down the lane. 

Dumbledore and Harry followed. As they passed the 
wooden sign, Harry looked up at its two arms. The 
one pointing back the way they had come read: 

GREAT HANGLETON, 5 MILES. The arm pointing 
after Ogden said LITTLE HANGLETON, 1 MILE. 

They walked a short way with nothing to see but the 
hedgerows, the wide blue sky overhead and the 
swishing, frock-coated figure ahead. Then the lane 

Page | 223 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




curved to the left and fell away, sloping steeply down 
a hillside, so that they had a sudden, unexpected 
view of a whole valley laid out in front of them. Harry 
could see a village, undoubtedly Little Hangleton, 
nestled between two steep hills, its church and 
graveyard clearly visible. Across the valley, set on the 
opposite hillside, was a handsome manor house 
surrounded by a wide expanse of velvety green lawn. 

Ogden had broken into a reluctant trot due to the 
steep downward slope. Dumbledore lengthened his 
stride, and Harry hurried to keep up. He thought 
Little Hangleton must be their final destination and 
wondered, as he had done on the night they had 
found Slughorn, why they had to approach it from 
such a distance. He soon discovered that he was 
mistaken in thinking that they were going to the 
village, however. The lane curved to the right and 
when they rounded the corner, it was to see the very 
edge of Ogden’s frock coat vanishing through a gap in 
the hedge. 

Dumbledore and Harry followed him onto a narrow 
dirt track bordered by higher and wilder hedgerows 
than those they had left behind. The path was 
crooked, rocky, and potholed, sloping downhill like 
the last one, and it seemed to be heading for a patch 
of dark trees a little below them. Sure enough, the 
track soon opened up at the copse, and Dumbledore 
and Harry came to a halt behind Ogden, who had 
stopped and drawn his wand. 

Despite the cloudless sky, the old trees ahead cast 
deep, dark, cool shadows, and it was a few seconds 
before Harry’s eyes discerned the building half-hidden 
amongst the tangle of trunks. It seemed to him a very 
strange location to choose for a house, or else an odd 
decision to leave the trees growing nearby, blocking 
all light and the view of the valley below. He wondered 
Page | 224 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




whether it was inhabited; its walls were mossy and so 
many tiles had fallen off the roof that the rafters were 
visible in places. Nettles grew all around it, their tips 
reaching the windows, which were tiny and thick with 
grime. Just as he had concluded that nobody could 
possibly live there, however, one of the windows was 
thrown open with a clatter, and a thin trickle of steam 
or smoke issued from it, as though somebody was 
cooking. 

Ogden moved forward quietly and, it seemed to Harry, 
rather cautiously. As the dark shadows of the trees 
slid over him, he stopped again, staring at the front 
door, to which somebody had nailed a dead snake. 

Then there was a rustle and a crack, and a man in 
rags dropped from the nearest tree, landing on his 
feet right in front of Ogden, who leapt backward so 
fast he stood on the tails of his frock coat and 
stumbled. 

“ You’re not welcome.” 

The man standing before them had thick hair so 
matted with dirt it could have been any color. Several 
of his teeth were missing. His eyes were small and 
dark and stared in opposite directions. He might have 
looked comical, but he did not; the effect was 
frightening, and Harry could not blame Ogden for 
backing away several more paces before he spoke. 

“Er — good morning. I’m from the Ministry of Magic 



“ You’re not welcome.” 

“Er — I’m sorry — I don’t understand you,” said 
Ogden nervously. 



Page | 225 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Harry thought Ogden was being extremely dim; the 
stranger was making himself very clear in Harry’s 
opinion, particularly as he was brandishing a wand in 
one hand and a short and rather bloody knife in the 
other. 

“You understand him, I’m sure, Harry?” said 
Dumbledore quietly. 

“Yes, of course,” said Harry, slightly nonplussed. 

“Why can’t Ogden — ?” 

But as his eyes found the dead snake on the door 
again, he suddenly understood. 

“He’s speaking Parseltongue?” 

“Very good,” said Dumbledore, nodding and smiling. 

The man in rags was now advancing on Ogden, knife 
in one hand, wand in the other. 

“Now, look — ” Ogden began, but too late: There was a 
bang, and Ogden was on the ground, clutching his 
nose, while a nasty yellowish goo squirted from 
between his fingers. 

“Morfin!” said a loud voice. 

An elderly man had come hurrying out of the cottage, 
banging the door behind him so that the dead snake 
swung pathetically. This man was shorter than the 
first, and oddly proportioned; his shoulders were very 
broad and his arms overlong, which, with his bright 
brown eyes, short scrubby hair, and wrinkled face, 
gave him the look of a powerful, aged monkey. He 
came to a halt beside the man with the knife, who 
was now cackling with laughter at the sight of Ogden 
on the ground. 

Page | 226 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Ministry, is it?” said the older man, looking down at 
Ogden. 

“Correct!” said Ogden angrily, dabbing his face. “And 
you, I take it, are Mr. Gaunt?” 

“S’right,” said Gaunt. “Got you in the face, did he?” 

“Yes, he did!” snapped Ogden. 

“Should’ve made your presence known, shouldn’t 
you?” said Gaunt aggressively. “This is private 
property. Can’t just walk in here and not expect my 
son to defend himself.” 

“Defend himself against what, man?” said Ogden, 
clambering back to his feet. 

“Busybodies. Intruders. Muggles and filth.” 

Ogden pointed his wand at his own nose, which was 
still issuing large amounts of what looked like yellow 
pus, and the flow stopped at once. Mr. Gaunt spoke 
out of the corner of his mouth to Morfin. 

“Get in the house. Don’t argue.” 

This time, ready for it, Harry recognized Parseltongue; 
even while he could understand what was being said, 
he distinguished the weird hissing noise that was all 
Ogden could hear. Morfin seemed to be on the point 
of disagreeing, but when his father cast him a 
threatening look he changed his mind, lumbering 
away to the cottage with an odd rolling gait and 
slamming the front door behind him, so that the 
snake swung sadly again. 



Page | 227 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“It’s your son I’m here to see, Mr. Gaunt,” said Ogden, 
as he mopped the last of the pus from the front of his 
coat. “That was Morfin, wasn’t it?” 

“Ar, that was Morfin,” said the old man indifferently. 
“Are you pure-blood?” he asked, suddenly aggressive. 

“That’s neither here nor there,” said Ogden coldly, 
and Harry felt his respect for Ogden rise. Apparently 
Gaunt felt rather differently. He squinted into Ogden’s 
face and muttered, in what was clearly supposed to 
be an offensive tone, “Now I come to think about it, 

I’ve seen noses like yours down in the village.” 

“I don’t doubt it, if your son’s been let loose on them,” 
said Ogden. “Perhaps we could continue this 
discussion inside?” 

“Inside?” 

“Yes, Mr. Gaunt. I’ve already told you. I’m here about 
Morfin. We sent an owl — ” 

“I’ve no use for owls,” said Gaunt. “I don’t open 
letters.” 

“Then you can hardly complain that you get no 
warning of visitors,” said Ogden tartly. “I am here 
following a serious breach of Wizarding law, which 
occurred here in the early hours of this morning — ” 

“All right, all right, all right!” bellowed Gaunt. “Come 
in the bleeding house, then, and much good it’ll do 
you!” 

The house seemed to contain three tiny rooms. Two 
doors led off the main room, which served as kitchen 
and living room combined. Morfin was sitting in a 
filthy armchair beside the smoking fire, twisting a live 

Page | 228 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




adder between his thick fingers and crooning softly at 
it in Parseltongue: 

Hissy, hissy, little snakey, 

Slither on the floor, 

You be good to Morfin 
Or hell nail you to the door. 

There was a scuffling noise in the corner beside the 
open window, and Harry realized that there was 
somebody else in the room, a girl whose ragged gray 
dress was the exact color of the dirty stone wall 
behind her. She was standing beside a steaming pot 
on a grimy black stove, and was fiddling around with 
the shelf of squalid-looking pots and pans above it. 
Her hair was lank and dull and she had a plain, pale, 
rather heavy face. Her eyes, like her brother’s, stared 
in opposite directions. She looked a little cleaner than 
the two men, but Harry thought he had never seen a 
more defeated-looking person. 

“M’daughter, Merope,” said Gaunt grudgingly, as 
Ogden looked inquiringly toward her. 

“Good morning,” said Ogden. 

She did not answer, but with a frightened glance at 
her father turned her back on the room and 
continued shifting the pots on the shelf behind her. 

“Well, Mr. Gaunt,” said Ogden, “to get straight to the 
point, we have reason to believe that your son, 

Morfin, performed magic in front of a Muggle late last 
night.” 

There was a deafening clang. Merope had dropped 
one of the pots. 



Page | 229 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Pick it up\” Gaunt bellowed at her. “That’s it, grub on 
the floor like some filthy Muggle, what’s your wand 
for, you useless sack of muck?” 

“Mr. Gaunt, please!” said Ogden in a shocked voice, 
as Merope, who had already picked up the pot, 
flushed blotchily scarlet, lost her grip on the pot 
again, drew her wand shakily from her pocket, 
pointed it at the pot, and muttered a hasty, inaudible 
spell that caused the pot to shoot across the floor 
away from her, hit the opposite wall, and crack in 
two. 

Morfin let out a mad cackle of laughter. Gaunt 
screamed, “Mend it, you pointless lump, mend it!” 

Merope stumbled across the room, but before she had 
time to raise her wand, Ogden had lifted his own and 
said firmly, “Reparo.” The pot mended itself instantly. 

Gaunt looked for a moment as though he was going to 
shout at Ogden, but seemed to think better of it: 
Instead, he jeered at his daughter, “Lucky the nice 
man from the Ministry’s here, isn’t it? Perhaps he’ll 
take you off my hands, perhaps he doesn’t mind dirty 
Squibs. ...” 

Without looking at anybody or thanking Ogden, 
Merope picked up the pot and returned it, hands 
trembling, to its shelf. She then stood quite still, her 
back against the wall between the filthy window and 
the stove, as though she wished for nothing more 
than to sink into the stone and vanish. 

“Mr. Gaunt,” Ogden began again, “as I’ve said: the 
reason for my visit — ” 



Page | 230 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“I heard you the first time!” snapped Gaunt. “And so 
what? Morfin gave a Muggle a bit of what was coming 
to him — what about it, then?” 

“Morfin has broken Wizarding law,” said Ogden 
sternly. 

“ ‘Morfin has broken Wizarding law.’ ” Gaunt imitated 
Ogden’s voice, making it pompous and singsong. 
Morfin cackled again. “He taught a filthy Muggle a 
lesson, that’s illegal now, is it?” 

“Yes,” said Ogden. “I’m afraid it is.” 

He pulled from an inside pocket a small scroll of 
parchment and unrolled it. 

“What’s that, then, his sentence?” said Gaunt, his 
voice rising angrily. 

“It is a summons to the Ministry for a hearing — ” 

“Summons! Summons? Who do you think you are, 
summoning my son anywhere?” 

“I’m Head of the Magical Law Enforcement Squad,” 
said Ogden. 

“And you think we’re scum, do you?” screamed 
Gaunt, advancing on Ogden now, with a dirty yellow- 
nailed finger pointing at his chest. “Scum who’ll come 
running when the Ministry tells ’em to? Do you know 
who you’re talking to, you filthy little Mudblood, do 
you? 

“I was under the impression that I was speaking to 
Mr. Gaunt,” said Ogden, looking wary, but standing 
his ground. 



Page | 231 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“That’s right!” roared Gaunt. For a moment, Harry 
thought Gaunt was making an obscene hand gesture, 
but then realized that he was showing Ogden the 
ugly, black- stoned ring he was wearing on his middle 
finger, waving it before Ogden’s eyes. “See this? See 
this? Know what it is? Know where it came from? 
Centuries it’s been in our family, that’s how far back 
we go, and pure-blood all the way! Know how much 
I’ve been offered for this, with the Peverell coat of 
arms engraved on the stone?” 

“I’ve really no idea,” said Ogden, blinking as the ring 
sailed within an inch of his nose, “and it’s quite 
beside the point, Mr. Gaunt. Your son has committed 



With a howl of rage, Gaunt ran toward his daughter. 
For a split second, Harry thought he was going to 
throttle her as his hand flew to her throat; next 
moment, he was dragging her toward Ogden by a gold 
chain around her neck. 

“See this?” he bellowed at Ogden, shaking a heavy 
gold locket at him, while Merope spluttered and 
gasped for breath. 

“I see it, I see it!” said Ogden hastily. 

“Slytherin’sl” yelled Gaunt. “Salazar Slytherin’s! We’re 
his last living descendants, what do you say to that, 
eh?” 

“Mr. Gaunt, your daughter!” said Ogden in alarm, but 
Gaunt had already released Merope; she staggered 
away from him, back to her corner, massaging her 
neck and gulping for air. 

“So!” said Gaunt triumphantly, as though he had just 
proved a complicated point beyond all possible 

Page | 232 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




dispute. “Don’t you go talking to us as if we’re dirt on 
your shoes! Generations of purebloods, wizards all — 
more than you can say, I don’t doubt!” 

And he spat on the floor at Ogden’s feet. Morfin 
cackled again. Merope, huddled beside the window, 
her head bowed and her face hidden by her lank hair, 
said nothing. 

“Mr. Gaunt,” said Ogden doggedly, “I am afraid that 
neither your ancestors nor mine have anything to do 
with the matter in hand. I am here because of Morfin, 
Morfin and the Muggle he accosted late last night. 

Our information” — he glanced down at his scroll of 
parchment — “is that Morfin performed a jinx or hex 
on the said Muggle, causing him to erupt in highly 
painful hives.” 

Morfin giggled. 

“ Be quiet, boy,” snarled Gaunt in Parseltongue, and 
Morfin fell silent again. 

“And so what if he did, then?” Gaunt said defiantly to 
Ogden. “I expect you’ve wiped the Muggle ’s filthy face 
clean for him, and his memory to boot — ” 

“That’s hardly the point, is it, Mr. Gaunt?” said 
Ogden. “This was an unprovoked attack on a 
defenseless — ” 

“Ar, I had you marked out as a Muggle-lover the 
moment I saw you,” sneered Gaunt, and he spat on 
the floor again. 

“This discussion is getting us nowhere,” said Ogden 
firmly. “It is clear from your son’s attitude that he 
feels no remorse for his actions.” He glanced down at 
his scroll of parchment again. “Morfin will attend a 

Page | 233 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




hearing on the fourteenth of September to answer the 
charges of using magic in front of a Muggle and 
causing harm and distress to that same Mugg — ” 

Ogden broke off. The jingling, clopping sounds of 
horses and loud, laughing voices were drifting in 
through the open window. Apparently the winding 
lane to the village passed very close to the copse 
where the house stood. Gaunt froze, listening, his 
eyes wide. Morfin hissed and turned his face toward 
the sounds, his expression hungry. Merope raised her 
head. Her face, Harry saw, was starkly white. 

“My God, what an eyesore!” rang out a girl’s voice, as 
clearly audible through the open window as if she had 
stood in the room beside them. “Couldn’t your father 
have that hovel cleared away, Tom?” 

“It’s not ours,” said a young man’s voice. “Everything 
on the other side of the valley belongs to us, but that 
cottage belongs to an old tramp called Gaunt, and his 
children. The son’s quite mad, you should hear some 
of the stories they tell in the village — ” 

The girl laughed. The jingling, clopping noises were 
growing louder and louder. Morfin made to get out of 
his armchair. 

“Keep your seat,” said his father warningly, in 
Parseltongue. 

“Tom,” said the girl’s voice again, now so close they 
were clearly right beside the house, “I might be wrong 
— but has somebody nailed a snake to that door?” 

“Good lord, you’re right!” said the man’s voice. “That’ll 
be the son, I told you he’s not right in the head. Don’t 
look at it, Cecilia, darling.” 



Page | 234 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




The jingling and clopping sounds were now growing 
fainter again. 

“ ‘Darling,’ ” whispered Morfin in Parseltongue, 
looking at his sister. “ ‘Darling,’ he called her. So he 
wouldn’t have you anyway.” 

Merope was so white Harry felt sure she was going to 
faint. 

“What’s that?” said Gaunt sharply, also in 
Parseltongue, looking from his son to his daughter. 

“ What did you say, Morfin?” 

“She likes looking at that Muggle,” said Morfin, a 
vicious expression on his face as he stared at his 
sister, who now looked terrified. “Always in the 
garden when he passes, peering through the hedge at 
him, isn’t she? And last night — ” 

Merope shook her head jerkily, imploringly, but 
Morfin went on ruthlessly, “Hanging out of the 
window waiting for him to ride home, wasn’t she?” 

“Hanging out of the window to look at a Muggle?” said 
Gaunt quietly. 

All three of the Gaunts seemed to have forgotten 
Ogden, who was looking both bewildered and irritated 
at this renewed outbreak of incomprehensible hissing 
and rasping. 

“Is it true?” said Gaunt in a deadly voice, advancing a 
step or two toward the terrified girl. “My daughter — 
pure-blooded descendant of Salazar Slytherin — 
hankering after a filthy, dirt-veined Muggle?” 

Merope shook her head frantically, pressing herself 
into the wall, apparently unable to speak. 

Page | 235 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“But I got him, FatheA” cackled Morfin. “I got him as 
he went by and he didn’t look so pretty with hives all 
over him, did he, Merope?” 

“You disgusting little Squib, you filthy little blood 
traitoA.” roared Gaunt, losing control, and his hands 
closed around his daughter’s throat. 

Both Harry and Ogden yelled “No!” at the same time; 
Ogden raised his wand and cried, “Relashiol” Gaunt 
was thrown backward, away from his daughter; he 
tripped over a chair and fell flat on his back. With a 
roar of rage, Morfin leapt out of his chair and ran at 
Ogden, brandishing his bloody knife and firing hexes 
indiscriminately from his wand. 

Ogden ran for his life. Dumbledore indicated that they 
ought to follow and Harry obeyed, Merope ’s screams 
echoing in his ears. 

Ogden hurtled up the path and erupted onto the main 
lane, his arms over his head, where he collided with 
the glossy chestnut horse ridden by a very handsome, 
dark-haired young man. Both he and the pretty girl 
riding beside him on a gray horse roared with 
laughter at the sight of Ogden, who bounced off the 
horse’s flank and set off again, his frock coat flying, 
covered from head to foot in dust, running pell-mell 
up the lane. 

“I think that will do, Harry,” said Dumbledore. He 
took Harry by the elbow and tugged. Next moment, 
they were both soaring weightlessly through 
darkness, until they landed squarely on their feet, 
back in Dumbledore ’s now twilit office. 

“What happened to the girl in the cottage?” said Harry 
at once, as Dumbledore lit extra lamps with a flick of 
his wand. “Merope, or whatever her name was?” 

Page | 236 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Oh, she survived,” said Dumbledore, reseating 
himself behind his desk and indicating that Harry 
should sit down too. “Ogden Apparated back to the 
Ministry and returned with reinforcements within 
fifteen minutes. Morfin and his father attempted to 
fight, but both were overpowered, removed from the 
cottage, and subsequently convicted by the 
Wizengamot. Morfin, who already had a record of 
Muggle attacks, was sentenced to three years in 
Azkaban. Marvolo, who had injured several Ministry 
employees in addition to Ogden, received six months.” 

“Marvolo?” Harry repeated wonderingly. 

“That’s right,” said Dumbledore, smiling in approval. 

“I am glad to see you’re keeping up.” 

“That old man was — ?” 

“Voldemort’s grandfather, yes,” said Dumbledore. 
“Marvolo, his son, Morfin, and his daughter, Merope, 
were the last of the Gaunts, a very ancient Wizarding 
family noted for a vein of instability and violence that 
flourished through the generations due to their habit 
of marrying their own cousins. Lack of sense coupled 
with a great liking for grandeur meant that the family 
gold was squandered several generations before 
Marvolo was born. He, as you saw, was left in squalor 
and poverty, with a very nasty temper, a fantastic 
amount of arrogance and pride, and a couple of 
family heirlooms that he treasured just as much as 
his son, and rather more than his daughter.” 

“So Merope,” said Harry, leaning forward in his chair 
and staring at Dumbledore, “so Merope was ... Sir, 
does that mean she was ... Voldemort’s mother?” 



Page | 237 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“It does,” said Dumbledore. “And it so happens that 
we also had a glimpse of Voldemort’s father. I wonder 
whether you noticed?” 

“The Muggle Morfin attacked? The man on the 
horse?” 

“Very good indeed,” said Dumbledore, beaming. “Yes, 
that was Tom Riddle senior, the handsome Muggle 
who used to go riding past the Gaunt cottage and for 
whom Merope Gaunt cherished a secret, burning 
passion.” 

“And they ended up married?” Harry said in disbelief, 
unable to imagine two people less likely to fall in love. 

“I think you are forgetting,” said Dumbledore, “that 
Merope was a witch. I do not believe that her magical 
powers appeared to their best advantage when she 
was being terrorized by her father. Once Marvolo and 
Morfin were safely in Azkaban, once she was alone 
and free for the first time in her life, then, I am sure, 
she was able to give full rein to her abilities and to 
plot her escape from the desperate life she had led for 
eighteen years. 

“Can you not think of any measure Merope could 
have taken to make Tom Riddle forget his Muggle 
companion, and fall in love with her instead?” 

“The Imperius Curse?” Harry suggested. “Or a love 
potion?” 

“Very good. Personally, I am inclined to think that she 
used a love potion. I am sure it would have seemed 
more romantic to her, and I do not think it would 
have been very difficult, some hot day, when Riddle 
was riding alone, to persuade him to take a drink of 
water. In any case, within a few months of the scene 
Page | 238 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




we have just witnessed, the village of Little Hangleton 
enjoyed a tremendous scandal. You can imagine the 
gossip it caused when the squire’s son ran off with 
the tramp’s daughter, Merope. 

“But the villagers’ shock was nothing to Marvolo’s. He 
returned from Azkaban, expecting to find his 
daughter dutifully awaiting his return with a hot meal 
ready on his table. Instead, he found a clear inch of 
dust and her note of farewell, explaining what she 
had done. 

“From all that I have been able to discover, he never 
mentioned her name or existence from that time 
forth. The shock of her desertion may have 
contributed to his early death — or perhaps he had 
simply never learned to feed himself. Azkaban had 
greatly weakened Marvolo, and he did not live to see 
Morfin return to the cottage.” 

“And Merope? She ... she died, didn’t she? Wasn’t 
Voldemort brought up in an orphanage?” 

“Yes, indeed,” said Dumbledore. “We must do a 
certain amount of guessing here, although I do not 
think it is difficult to deduce what happened. You see, 
within a few months of their runaway marriage, Tom 
Riddle reappeared at the manor house in Little 
Hangleton without his wife. The rumor flew around 
the neighborhood that he was talking of being 
‘hoodwinked’ and ‘taken in.’ What he meant, I am 
sure, is that he had been under an enchantment that 
had now lifted, though I daresay he did not dare use 
those precise words for fear of being thought insane. 
When they heard what he was saying, however, the 
villagers guessed that Merope had lied to Tom Riddle, 
pretending that she was going to have his baby, and 
that he had married her for this reason.” 



Page | 239 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“But she did have his baby.” 



“But not until a year after they were married. Tom 
Riddle left her while she was still pregnant.” 

“What went wrong?” asked Harry. “Why did the love 
potion stop working?” 

“Again, this is guesswork,” said Dumbledore, “but I 
believe that Merope, who was deeply in love with her 
husband, could not bear to continue enslaving him by 
magical means. I believe that she made the choice to 
stop giving him the potion. Perhaps, besotted as she 
was, she had convinced herself that he would by now 
have fallen in love with her in return. Perhaps she 
thought he would stay for the baby’s sake. If so, she 
was wrong on both counts. He left her, never saw her 
again, and never troubled to discover what became of 
his son.” 

The sky outside was inky black and the lamps in 
Dumbledore ’s office seemed to glow more brightly 
than before. 

“I think that will do for tonight, Harry,” said 
Dumbledore after a moment or two. 

“Yes, sir,” said Harry. 

He got to his feet, but did not leave. 

“Sir ... is it important to know all this about 
Voldemort’s past?” 

“Very important, I think,” said Dumbledore. 

“And it ... it’s got something to do with the prophecy?” 

“It has everything to do with the prophecy.” 

Page | 240 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Right,” said Harry, a little confused, but reassured 
all the same. 

He turned to go, then another question occurred to 
him, and he turned back again. “Sir, am I allowed to 
tell Ron and Hermione everything you’ve told me?” 

Dumbledore considered him for a moment, then said, 
“Yes, I think Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger have 
proved themselves trustworthy. But Harry, I am going 
to ask you to ask them not to repeat any of this to 
anybody else. It would not be a good idea if word got 
around how much I know, or suspect, about Lord 
Voldemort’s secrets.” 

“No, sir, I’ll make sure it’s just Ron and Hermione. 
Good night.” 

He turned away again, and was almost at the door 
when he saw it. Sitting on one of the little spindle- 
legged tables that supported so many frail-looking 
silver instruments, was an ugly gold ring set with a 
large, cracked, black stone. 

“Sir,” said Harry, staring at it. “That ring — ” 

“Yes?” said Dumbledore. 

“You were wearing it when we visited Professor 
Slughorn that night.” 

“So I was,” Dumbledore agreed. 

“But isn’t it ... sir, isn’t it the same ring Marvolo 
Gaunt showed Ogden?” 

Dumbledore bowed his head. “The very same.” 

“But how come — ? Have you always had it?” 

Page | 241 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“No, I acquired it very recently,” said Dumbledore. “A 
few days before I came to fetch you from your aunt 
and uncle’s, in fact.” 

“That would be around the time you injured your 
hand, then, sir?” 

“Around that time, yes, Harry.” 

Harry hesitated. Dumbledore was smiling. 

“Sir, how exactly — ?” 

“Too late, Harry! You shall hear the story another 
time. Good night.” 

“Good night, sir.”

HERMIONE’S HELPING HAND 

As Hermione had predicted, the sixth years’ free 
periods were not the hours of blissful relaxation Ron 
had anticipated, but times in which to attempt to 
keep up with the vast amount of homework they were 
being set. Not only were they studying as though they 
had exams every day, but the lessons themselves had 
become more demanding than ever before. Harry 
barely understood half of what Professor McGonagall 
said to them these days; even Hermione had had to 
ask her to repeat instructions once or twice. 
Incredibly, and to Hermione ’s increasing resentment, 
Harry’s best subject had suddenly become Potions, 
thanks to the Half-Blood Prince. 

Nonverbal spells were now expected, not only in 
Defense Against the Dark Arts, but in Charms and 
Transfiguration too. Harry frequently looked over at 
his classmates in the common room or at mealtimes 
to see them purple in the face and straining as 
though they had overdosed on U-No-Poo; but he knew 
that they were really struggling to make spells work 



Page | 243 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 



without saying incantations aloud. It was a relief to 
get outside into the greenhouses; they were dealing 
with more dangerous plants than ever in Herbology, 
but at least they were still allowed to swear loudly if 
the Venomous Tentacula seized them unexpectedly 
from behind. 

One result of their enormous workload and the frantic 
hours of practicing nonverbal spells was that Harry, 
Ron, and Hermione had so far been unable to find 
time to go and visit Hagrid. He had stopped coming to 
meals at the staff table, an ominous sign, and on the 
few occasions when they had passed him in the 
corridors or out in the grounds, he had mysteriously 
failed to notice them or hear their greetings. 

“We’ve got to go and explain,” said Hermione, looking 
up at Hagrid ’s huge empty chair at the staff table the 
following Saturday at breakfast. 

“We’ve got Quidditch tryouts this morning!” said Ron. 
“And we’re supposed to be practicing that Aguamenti 
Charm from Flitwick! Anyway, explain what? How are 
we going to tell him we hated his stupid subject?” 

“We didn’t hate it!” said Hermione. 

“Speak for yourself, I haven’t forgotten the skrewts,” 
said Ron darkly. “And I’m telling you now, we’ve had a 
narrow escape. You didn’t hear him going on about 
his gormless brother — we’d have been teaching 
Grawp how to tie his shoelaces if we’d stayed.” 

“I hate not talking to Hagrid,” said Hermione, looking 
upset. 

“Well go down after Quidditch,” Harry assured her. 

He too was missing Hagrid, although like Ron he 
thought that they were better off without Grawp in 

Page | 244 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




their lives. “But trials might take all morning, the 
number of people who have applied.” He felt slightly 
nervous at confronting the first hurdle of his 
Captaincy. “I dunno why the team’s this popular all of 
a sudden.” 

“Oh, come on, Harry,” said Hermione, suddenly 
impatient. “It’s not Quidditch that’s popular, it’s you! 
You’ve never been more interesting, and frankly, 
you’ve never been more fanciable.” 

Ron gagged on a large piece of kipper. Hermione 
spared him one look of disdain before turning back to 
Harry. 

“Everyone knows you’ve been telling the truth now, 
don’t they? The whole Wizarding world has had to 
admit that you were right about Voldemort being back 
and that you really have fought him twice in the last 
two years and escaped both times. And now they’re 
calling you ‘the Chosen One’ — well, come on, can’t 
you see why people are fascinated by you?” 

Harry was finding the Great Hall very hot all of a 
sudden, even though the ceiling still looked cold and 
rainy. 

“And you’ve been through all that persecution from 
the Ministry when they were trying to make out you 
were unstable and a liar. You can still see the marks 
on the back of your hand where that evil woman 
made you write with your own blood, but you stuck to 
your story anyway. ...” 

“You can still see where those brains got hold of me in 
the Ministry, look,” said Ron, shaking back his 
sleeves. 



Page | 245 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“And it doesn’t hurt that you’ve grown about a foot 
over the summer either,” Hermione finished, ignoring 
Ron. 

“I’m tall,” said Ron inconsequentially. 

The post owls arrived, swooping down through rain- 
flecked windows, scattering everyone with droplets of 
water. Most people were receiving more post than 
usual; anxious parents were keen to hear from their 
children and to reassure them, in turn, that all was 
well at home. Harry had received no mail since the 
start of term; his only regular correspondent was now 
dead and although he had hoped that Lupin might 
write occasionally, he had so far been disappointed. 
He was very surprised, therefore, to see the snowy 
white Hedwig circling amongst all the brown and gray 
owls. She landed in front of him carrying a large, 
square package. A moment later, an identical package 
landed in front of Ron, crushing beneath it his 
minuscule and exhausted owl, Pigwidgeon. 

“Ha!” said Harry, unwrapping the parcel to reveal a 
new copy of Advanced Potion-Making, fresh from 
Flourish and Blotts. 

“Oh good,” said Hermione, delighted. “Now you can 
give that graffitied copy back.” 

“Are you mad?” said Harry. “I’m keeping it! Look, I’ve 
thought it out — ” 

He pulled the old copy of Advanced Potion-Making out 
of his bag and tapped the cover with his wand, 
muttering, “Diffindol” The cover fell off. He did the 
same thing with the brand-new book (Hermione 
looked scandalized). He then swapped the covers, 
tapped each, and said, “Reparo\” 



Page | 246 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




There sat the Prince’s copy, disguised as a new book, 
and there sat the fresh copy from Flourish and Blotts, 
looking thoroughly secondhand. 

“I’ll give Slughorn back the new one, he can’t 
complain, it cost nine Galleons.” 

Hermione pressed her lips together, looking angry 
and disapproving, but was distracted by a third owl 
landing in front of her carrying that day’s copy of the 
Daily Prophet. She unfolded it hastily and scanned 
the front page. 

“Anyone we know dead?” asked Ron in a determinedly 
casual voice; he posed the same question every time 
Hermione opened her paper. 

“No, but there have been more dementor attacks,” 
said Hermione. “And an arrest.” 

“Excellent, who?” said Harry, thinking of Bellatrix 
Lestrange. 

“Stan Shunpike,” said Hermione. 

“What?” said Harry, startled. 

“ ‘Stanley Shunpike , conductor on the popular 
Wizarding conveyance the Knight Bus, has been 
arrested on suspicion of Death Eater activity. Mr. 
Shunpike, 21, was taken into custody late last night 
after a raid on his Clapham home ...’ ” 

“Stan Shunpike, a Death Eater?” said Harry, 
remembering the spotty youth he had first met three 
years before. “No way!” 

“He might have been put under the Imperius Curse,” 
said Ron reasonably. “You never can tell.” 

Page | 247 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“It doesn’t look like it,” said Hermione, who was still 
reading. “It says here he was arrested after he was 
overheard talking about the Death Eaters’ secret 
plans in a pub.” She looked up with a troubled 
expression on her face. “If he was under the Imperius 
Curse, he’d hardly stand around gossiping about 
their plans, would he?” 

“It sounds like he was trying to make out he knew 
more than he did,” said Ron. “Isn’t he the one who 
claimed he was going to become Minister of Magic 
when he was trying to chat up those veela?” 

“Yeah, that’s him,” said Harry. “I dunno what they’re 
playing at, taking Stan seriously.” 

“They probably want to look as though they’re doing 
something,” said Hermione, frowning. “People are 
terrified — you know the Patil twins’ parents want 
them to go home? And Eloise Midgen has already 
been withdrawn. Her father picked her up last night.” 

“What!” said Ron, goggling at Hermione. “But 
Hogwarts is safer than their homes, bound to be! 
We’ve got Aurors, and all those extra protective spells, 
and we’ve got Dumbledore!” 

“I don’t think we’ve got him all the time,” said 
Hermione very quietly, glancing toward the staff table 
over the top of the Prophet “Haven’t you noticed? His 
seat’s been empty as often as Hagrid’s this past 
week.” 

Harry and Ron looked up at the staff table. The 
headmaster’s chair was indeed empty. Now Harry 
came to think of it, he had not seen Dumbledore 
since their private lesson a week ago. 



Page | 248 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“I think he’s left the school to do something with the 
Order,” said Hermione in a low voice. “I mean ... it’s 
all looking serious, isn’t it? 

Harry and Ron did not answer, but Harry knew that 
they were all thinking the same thing. There had been 
a horrible incident the day before, when Hannah 
Abbott had been taken out of Herbology to be told her 
mother had been found dead. They had not seen 
Hannah since. 

When they left the Gryffindor table five minutes later 
to head down to the Quidditch pitch, they passed 
Lavender Brown and Parvati Patil. Remembering what 
Hermione had said about the Patil twins’ parents 
wanting them to leave Hogwarts, Harry was 
unsurprised to see that the two best friends were 
whispering together, looking distressed. What did 
surprise him was that when Ron drew level with 
them, Parvati suddenly nudged Lavender, who looked 
around and gave Ron a wide smile. Ron blinked at 
her, then returned the smile uncertainly. His walk 
instantly became something more like a strut. Harry 
resisted the temptation to laugh, remembering that 
Ron had refrained from doing so after Malfoy had 
broken Harry’s nose; Hermione, however, looked cold 
and distant all the way down to the stadium through 
the cool, misty drizzle, and departed to find a place in 
the stands without wishing Ron good luck. 

As Harry had expected, the trials took most of the 
morning. Half of Gryffindor House seemed to have 
turned up, from first years who were nervously 
clutching a selection of the dreadful old school 
brooms, to seventh years who towered over the rest, 
looking coolly intimidating. The latter included a 
large, wiry-haired boy Harry recognized immediately 
from the Hogwarts Express. 



Page | 249 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“We met on the train, in old Sluggy’s compartment,” 
he said confidently, stepping out of the crowd to 
shake Harry’s hand. “Cormac McLaggen, Keeper.” 

“You didn’t try out last year, did you?” asked Harry, 
taking note of the breadth of McLaggen and thinking 
that he would probably block all three goal hoops 
without even moving. 

“I was in the hospital wing when they held the trials,” 
said McLaggen, with something of a swagger. “Ate a 
pound of doxy eggs for a bet.” 

“Right,” said Harry. “Well ... if you wait over there ...” 

He pointed over to the edge of the pitch, close to 
where Hermione was sitting. He thought he saw a 
flicker of annoyance pass over McLaggen’s face and 
wondered whether McLaggen expected preferential 
treatment because they were both “old Sluggy’s” 
favorites. 

Harry decided to start with a basic test, asking all 
applicants for the team to divide into groups of ten 
and fly once around the pitch. This was a good 
decision: The first ten was made up of first years and 
it could not have been plainer that they had hardly 
ever flown before. Only one boy managed to remain 
airborne for more than a few seconds, and he was so 
surprised he promptly crashed into one of the goal 
posts. 

The second group was comprised of ten of the silliest 
girls Harry had ever encountered, who, when he blew 
his whistle, merely fell about giggling and clutching 
one another. Romilda Vane was amongst them. When 
he told them to leave the pitch, they did so quite 
cheerfully and went to sit in the stands to heckle 
everyone else. 

Page | 250 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




The third group had a pileup halfway around the 
pitch. Most of the fourth group had come without 
broomsticks. The fifth group were Hufflepuffs. 

“If there’s anyone else here who’s not from 
Gryffindor,” roared Harry, who was starting to get 
seriously annoyed, “leave now, please!” 

There was a pause, then a couple of little Ravenclaws 
went sprinting off the pitch, snorting with laughter. 

After two hours, many complaints, and several 
tantrums, one involving a crashed Comet Two Sixty 
and several broken teeth, Harry had found himself 
three Chasers: Katie Bell, returned to the team after 
an excellent trial; a new find called Demelza Robins, 
who was particularly good at dodging Bludgers; and 
Ginny Weasley, who had outflown all the competition 
and scored seventeen goals to boot. Pleased though 
he was with his choices, Harry had also shouted 
himself hoarse at the many complainers and was now 
enduring a similar battle with the rejected Beaters. 

“That’s my final decision and if you don’t get out of 
the way for the Keepers I’ll hex you,” he bellowed. 

Neither of his chosen Beaters had the old brilliance of 
Fred and George, but he was still reasonably pleased 
with them: Jimmy Peakes, a short but broad-chested 
third-year boy who had managed to raise a lump the 
size of an egg on the back of Harry’s head with a 
ferociously hit Bludger, and Ritchie Coote, who looked 
weedy but aimed well. They now joined Katie, 

Demelza, and Ginny in the stands to watch the 
selection of their last team member. 

Harry had deliberately left the trial of the Keepers 
until last, hoping for an emptier stadium and less 
pressure on all concerned. Unfortunately, however, all 

Page | 251 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




the rejected players and a number of people who had 
come down to watch after a lengthy breakfast had 
joined the crowd by now, so that it was larger than 
ever. As each Keeper flew up to the goal hoops, the 
crowd roared and jeered in equal measure. Harry 
glanced over at Ron, who had always had a problem 
with nerves; Harry had hoped that winning their final 
match last term might have cured it, but apparently 
not: Ron was a delicate shade of green. 

None of the first five applicants saved more than two 
goals apiece. To Harry’s great disappointment, 

Cormac McLaggen saved four penalties out of five. On 
the last one, however, he shot off in completely the 
wrong direction; the crowd laughed and booed and 
McLaggen returned to the ground grinding his teeth. 

Ron looked ready to pass out as he mounted his 
Cleansweep Eleven. “Good luck!” cried a voice from 
the stands. Harry looked around, expecting to see 
Hermione, but it was Lavender Brown. He would have 
quite liked to have hidden his face in his hands, as 
she did a moment later, but thought that as the 
Captain he ought to show slightly more grit, and so 
turned to watch Ron do his trial. 

Yet he need not have worried: Ron saved one, two, 
three, four, five penalties in a row. Delighted, and 
resisting joining in the cheers of the crowd with 
difficulty, Harry turned to McLaggen to tell him that, 
most unfortunately, Ron had beaten him, only to find 
McLaggen’s red face inches from his own. He stepped 
back hastily. 

“His sister didn’t really try,” said McLaggen 
menacingly. There was a vein pulsing in his temple 
like the one Harry had often admired in Uncle 
Vernon’s. “She gave him an easy save.” 



Page | 252 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Rubbish,” said Harry coldly. “That was the one he 
nearly missed.” 

McLaggen took a step nearer Harry, who stood his 
ground this time. 

“Give me another go.” 

“No,” said Harry. “You’ve had your go. You saved four. 
Ron saved five. Ron’s Keeper, he won it fair and 
square. Get out of my way.” 

He thought for a moment that McLaggen might punch 
him, but he contented himself with an ugly grimace 
and stormed away, growling what sounded like 
threats to thin air. 

Harry turned around to find his new team beaming at 
him. 

“Well done,” he croaked. “You flew really well — ” 

“You did brilliantly, Ron!” 

This time it really was Hermione running toward 
them from the stands; Harry saw Lavender walking 
off the pitch, arm in arm with Parvati, a rather 
grumpy expression on her face. Ron looked extremely 
pleased with himself and even taller than usual as he 
grinned at the team and at Hermione. 

After fixing the time of their first full practice for the 
following Thursday, Harry, Ron, and Hermione bade 
good-bye to the rest of the team and headed off 
toward Hagrid’s. A watery sun was trying to break 
through the clouds now and it had stopped drizzling 
at last. Harry felt extremely hungry; he hoped there 
would be something to eat at Hagrid’s. 



Page | 253 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“I thought I was going to miss that fourth penalty,” 
Ron was saying happily. “Tricky shot from Demelza, 
did you see, had a bit of spin on it — ” 

“Yes, yes, you were magnificent,” said Hermione, 
looking amused. 

“I was better than that McLaggen anyway,” said Ron 
in a highly satisfied voice. “Did you see him 
lumbering off in the wrong direction on his fifth? 
Looked like he’d been Confunded. ...” 

To Harry’s surprise, Hermione turned a very deep 
shade of pink at these words. Ron noticed nothing; he 
was too busy describing each of his other penalties in 
loving detail. 

The great gray hippogriff, Buckbeak, was tethered in 
front of Hagrid’s cabin. He clicked his razor-sharp 
beak at their approach and turned his huge head 
toward them. 

“Oh dear,” said Hermione nervously. “He’s still a bit 
scary, isn’t he?” 

“Come off it, you’ve ridden him, haven’t you?” said 
Ron. 

Harry stepped forward and bowed low to the 
hippogriff without breaking eye contact or blinking. 
After a few seconds, Buckbeak sank into a bow too. 

“How are you?” Harry asked him in a low voice, 
moving forward to stroke the feathery head. “Missing 
him? But you’re okay here with Hagrid, aren’t you?” 

“Oi!” said a loud voice.

Hagrid had come striding around the corner of his 
cabin wearing a large flowery apron and carrying a 
sack of potatoes. His enormous boarhound, Fang, 
was at his heels; Fang gave a booming bark and 
bounded forward. 

“Git away from him! Hell have yer fingers — oh. It’s 
yeh lot.” 

Fang was jumping up at Hermione and Ron, 
attempting to lick their ears. Hagrid stood and looked 
at them all for a split second, then turned and strode 
into his cabin, slamming the door behind him. 

“Oh dear!” said Hermione, looking stricken. 

“Don’t worry about it,” said Harry grimly. He walked 
over to the door and knocked loudly. 

“Hagrid! Open up, we want to talk to you!” 

There was no sound from within. 

“If you don’t open the door, we’ll blast it open!” Harry 
said, pulling out his wand. 

“Harry!” said Hermione, sounding shocked. “You can’t 
possibly — ” 

“Yeah, I can!” said Harry. “Stand back — ” 

But before he could say anything else, the door flew 
open again as Harry had known it would, and there 
stood Hagrid, glowering down at him and looking, 
despite the flowery apron, positively alarming. 

“I’m a teacher!” he roared at Harry. “A teacher, Potter! 
How dare yeh threaten ter break down my door!” 



Page | 255 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




‘Tm sorry, sir,” said Harry, emphasizing the last word 
as he stowed his wand inside his robes. 

Hagrid looked stunned. “Since when have yeh called 
me ‘sir’?” 



“Since when have you called me ‘Potter’?” 

“Oh, very clever,” growled Hagrid. “Very amusin’. 
That’s me outsmarted, innit? All righ’, come in then, 
yeh ungrateful little ...” 

Mumbling darkly, he stood back to let them pass. 
Hermione scurried in after Harry, looking rather 
frightened. 

“Well?” said Hagrid grumpily, as Harry, Ron, and 
Hermione sat down around his enormous wooden 
table, Fang laying his head immediately upon Harry’s 
knee and drooling all over his robes. “What’s this? 
Feelin’ sorry for me? Reckon I’m lonely or summat?” 

“No,” said Harry at once. “We wanted to see you.” 

“We’ve missed you!” said Hermione tremulously. 

“Missed me, have yeh?” snorted Hagrid. “Yeah. Righ’.” 

He stomped around, brewing up tea in his enormous 
copper kettle, muttering all the while. Finally he 
slammed down three bucket-sized mugs of 
mahogany-brown tea in front of them and a plate of 
his rock cakes. Harry was hungry enough even for 
Hagrid’s cooking, and took one at once. 

“Hagrid,” said Hermione timidly, when he joined them 
at the table and started peeling his potatoes with a 
brutality that suggested that each tuber had done 



Page | 256 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




him a great personal wrong, “we really wanted to 
carry on with Care of Magical Creatures, you know.” 



Hagrid gave another great snort. Harry rather thought 
some bogeys landed on the potatoes, and was 
inwardly thankful that they were not staying for 
dinner. 

“We did!” said Hermione. “But none of us could fit it 
into our schedules!” 

“Yeah. Righ’,” said Hagrid again. 

There was a funny squelching sound and they all 
looked around: Hermione let out a tiny shriek, and 
Ron leapt out of his seat and hurried around the table 
away from the large barrel standing in the corner that 
they had only just noticed. It was full of what looked 
like foot-long maggots, slimy, white, and writhing. 

“What are they, Hagrid?” asked Harry, trying to sound 
interested rather than revolted, but putting down his 
rock cake all the same. 

“Jus’ giant grubs,” said Hagrid. 

“And they grow into ... ?” said Ron, looking 
apprehensive. 

“They won’ grow inter nuthin’,” said Hagrid. “I got ’em 
ter feed ter Aragog.” 

And without warning, he burst into tears. 

“Hagrid!” cried Hermione, leaping up, hurrying 
around the table the long way to avoid the barrel of 
maggots, and putting an arm around his shaking 
shoulders. “What is it?” 

Page | 257 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“It’s ... him ...” gulped Hagrid, his beetle-black eyes 
streaming as he mopped his face with his apron. “It’s 
... Aragog. ... I think he’s dyin’. ... He got ill over the 
summer an’ he’s not gettin’ better. ... I don’ know 
what I’ll do if he ... if he ... We’ve bin tergether so 
long. ...” 

Hermione patted Hagrid’s shoulder, looking at a 
complete loss for anything to say. Harry knew how 
she felt. He had known Hagrid to present a vicious 
baby dragon with a teddy bear, seen him croon over 
giant scorpions with suckers and stingers, attempt to 
reason with his brutal giant of a half-brother, but this 
was perhaps the most incomprehensible of all his 
monster fancies: the gigantic talking spider, Aragog, 
who dwelled deep in the Forbidden Forest and which 
he and Ron had only narrowly escaped four years 
previously. 

“Is there — is there anything we can do?” Hermione 
asked, ignoring Ron’s frantic grimaces and head- 
shakings. 

“I don’ think there is, Hermione,” choked Hagrid, 
attempting to stem the flood of his tears. “See, the 
rest o’ the tribe ... Aragog’s family ... they’re gettin’ a 
bit funny now he’s ill ... bit restive ...” 

“Yeah, I think we saw a bit of that side of them,” said 
Ron in an undertone. 

"... I don’ reckon it’d be safe fer anyone but me ter go 
near the colony at the mo’,” Hagrid finished, blowing 
his nose hard on his apron and looking up. “But 
thanks fer offerin’, Hermione. ... It means a lot. ...” 

After that, the atmosphere lightened considerably, for 
although neither Harry nor Ron had shown any 
inclination to go and feed giant grubs to a murderous, 

Page | 258 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




gargantuan spider, Hagrid seemed to take it for 
granted that they would have liked to have done and 
became his usual self once more. 

“Ar, I always knew yeh’d find it hard ter squeeze me 
inter yer timetables,” he said gruffly, pouring them 
more tea. “Even if yeh applied fer Time-Turners — ” 

“We couldn’t have done,” said Hermione. “We 
smashed the entire stock of Ministry Time-Turners 
when we were there last summer. It was in the Daily 
Prophet.” 

“Ar, well then,” said Hagrid. “There’s no way yeh 
could’ve done it. ... I’m sorry I’ve bin — yeh know — 
I’ve jus’ bin worried abou’ Aragog ... an’ I did wonder 
whether, if Professor Grubbly-Plank had bin teachin’ 
yeh 

At which all three of them stated categorically and 
untruthfully that Professor Grubbly-Plank, who had 
substituted for Hagrid a few times, was a dreadful 
teacher, with the result that by the time Hagrid waved 
them off the premises at dusk, he looked quite 
cheerful. 

“I’m starving,” said Harry, once the door had closed 
behind them and they were hurrying through the 
dark and deserted grounds; he had abandoned the 
rock cake after an ominous cracking noise from one 
of his back teeth. “And I’ve got that detention with 
Snape tonight, I haven’t got much time for dinner. ...” 

As they came into the castle they spotted Cormac 
McLaggen entering the Great Hall. It took him two 
attempts to get through the doors; he ricocheted off 
the frame on the first attempt. Ron merely guffawed 
gloatingly and strode off into the Hall after him, but 
Harry caught Hermione ’s arm and held her back. 

Page | 259 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“What?” said Hermione defensively. 



“If you ask me,” said Harry quietly, “McLaggen looks 
like he was Confunded this morning. And he was 
standing right in front of where you were sitting.” 

Hermione blushed. 

“Oh, all right then, I did it,” she whispered. “But you 
should have heard the way he was talking about Ron 
and Ginny! Anyway, he’s got a nasty temper, you saw 
how he reacted when he didn’t get in — you wouldn’t 
have wanted someone like that on the team.” 

“No,” said Harry. “No, I suppose that’s true. But 
wasn’t that dishonest, Hermione? I mean, you’re a 
prefect, aren’t you?” 

“Oh, be quiet,” she snapped, as he smirked. 

“What are you two doing?” demanded Ron, 
reappearing in the doorway to the Great Hall and 
looking suspicious. 

“Nothing,” said Harry and Hermione together, and 
they hurried after Ron. The smell of roast beef made 
Harry’s stomach ache with hunger, but they had 
barely taken three steps toward the Gryffindor table 
when Professor Slughorn appeared in front of them, 
blocking their path. 

“Harry, Harry, just the man I was hoping to see!” he 
boomed genially, twiddling the ends of his walrus 
mustache and puffing out his enormous belly. “I was 
hoping to catch you before dinner! What do you say to 
a spot of supper tonight in my rooms instead? We’re 
having a little party, just a few rising stars, I’ve got 
McLaggen coming and Zabini, the charming Melinda 
Bobbin — I don’t know whether you know her? Her 
Page | 260 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




family owns a large chain of apothecaries — and, of 
course, I hope very much that Miss Granger will favor 
me by coming too.” 

Slughorn made Hermione a little bow as he finished 
speaking. It was as though Ron was not present; 
Slughorn did not so much as look at him. 

“I can’t come, Professor,” said Harry at once. “I’ve got 
a detention with Professor Snape.” 

“Oh dear!” said Slughorn, his face falling comically. 
“Dear, dear, I was counting on you, Harry! Well, now, 
I’ll just have to have a word with Severus and explain 
the situation. I’m sure I’ll be able to persuade him to 
postpone your detention. Yes, I’ll see you both later!” 

He bustled away out of the Hall. 

“He’s got no chance of persuading Snape,” said Harry, 
the moment Slughorn was out of earshot. “This 
detention’s already been postponed once; Snape did it 
for Dumbledore, but he won’t do it for anyone else.” 

“Oh, I wish you could come, I don’t want to go on my 
own!” said Hermione anxiously; Harry knew that she 
was thinking about McLaggen. 

“I doubt you’ll be alone, Ginny’ll probably be invited,” 
snapped Ron, who did not seem to have taken kindly 
to being ignored by Slughorn. 

After dinner they made their way back to Gryffindor 
Tower. The common room was very crowded, as most 
people had finished dinner by now, but they managed 
to find a free table and sat down; Ron, who had been 
in a bad mood ever since the encounter with 
Slughorn, folded his arms and frowned at the ceiling. 
Hermione reached out for a copy of the Evening 
Page | 261 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Prophet, which somebody had left abandoned on a 
chair. 

“Anything new?” said Harry. 

“Not really ...” Hermione had opened the newspaper 
and was scanning the inside pages. “Oh, look, your 
dad’s in here, Ron — he’s all right!” she added 
quickly, for Ron had looked around in alarm. “It just 
says he’s been to visit the Malfoys’ house. ‘This 
second search of the Death Eater’s residence does not 
seem to have yielded any results. Arthur Weasley of 
the Office for the Detection and Confiscation of 
Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects 
said that his team had been acting upon a confidential 
tip-off’” 

“Yeah, mine!” said Harry. “I told him at King’s Cross 
about Malfoy and that thing he was trying to get 
Borgin to fix! Well, if it’s not at their house, he must 
have brought whatever it is to Hogwarts with him — ” 

“But how can he have done, Harry?” said Hermione, 
putting down the newspaper with a surprised look. 
“We were all searched when we arrived, weren’t we?” 

“Were you?” said Harry, taken aback. “I wasn’t!” 

“Oh no, of course you weren’t, I forgot you were late. 

... Well, Filch ran over all of us with Secrecy Sensors 
when we got into the entrance hall. Any Dark object 
would have been found, I know for a fact Crabbe had 
a shrunken head confiscated. So you see, Malfoy can’t 
have brought in anything dangerous!” 

Momentarily stymied, Harry watched Ginny Weasley 
playing with Arnold the Pygmy Puff for a while before 
seeing a way around this objection. 



Page | 262 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Someone’s sent it to him by owl, then,” he said. “His 
mother or someone.” 

“All the owls are being checked too,” said Hermione. 
“Filch told us so when he was jabbing those Secrecy 
Sensors everywhere he could reach.” 

Really stumped this time, Harry found nothing else to 
say. There did not seem to be any way Malfoy could 
have brought a dangerous or Dark object into the 
school. He looked hopefully at Ron, who was sitting 
with his arms folded, staring over at Lavender Brown. 

“Can you think of any way Malfoy — ?” 

“Oh, drop it, Harry,” said Ron. 

“Listen, it’s not my fault Slughorn invited Hermione 
and me to his stupid party, neither of us wanted to 
go, you know!” said Harry, firing up. 

“Well, as I’m not invited to any parties,” said Ron, 
getting to his feet again, “I think I’ll go to bed.” 

He stomped off toward the door to the boys’ 
dormitories, leaving Harry and Hermione staring after 
him. 

“Harry?” said the new Chaser, Demelza Robins, 
appearing suddenly at his shoulder. “I’ve got a 
message for you.” 

“From Professor Slughorn?” asked Harry, sitting up 
hopefully. 

“No ... from Professor Snape,” said Demelza. Harry’s 
heart sank. “He says you’re to come to his office at 
half past eight tonight to do your detention — er — no 
matter how many party invitations you’ve received. 

Page | 263 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




And he wanted you to know you’ll be sorting out 
rotten flobberworms from good ones, to use in Potions 
and — and he says there’s no need to bring protective 
gloves.” 

“Right,” said Harry grimly. “Thanks a lot, Demelza.”

SILVER AND OPALS 

Where was Dumbledore, and what was he doing? 
Harry caught sight of the headmaster only twice over 
the next few weeks. He rarely appeared at meals 
anymore, and Harry was sure Hermione was right in 
thinking that he was leaving the school for days at a 
time. Had Dumbledore forgotten the lessons he was 
supposed to be giving Harry? Dumbledore had said 
that the lessons were leading to something to do with 
the prophecy; Harry had felt bolstered, comforted, 
and now he felt slightly abandoned. 

Halfway through October came their first trip of the 
term to Hogsmeade. Harry had wondered whether 
these trips would still be allowed, given the 
increasingly tight security measures around the 
school, but was pleased to know that they were going 
ahead; it was always good to get out of the castle 
grounds for a few hours. 

Harry woke early on the morning of the trip, which 
was proving stormy, and whiled away the time until 



Page | 265 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 



breakfast by reading his copy of Advanced Potion- 
Making. He did not usually lie in bed reading his 
textbooks; that sort of behavior, as Ron rightly said, 
was indecent in anybody except Hermione, who was 
simply weird that way. Harry felt, however, that the 
Half-Blood Prince’s copy of Advanced Potion-Making 
hardly qualified as a textbook. The more Harry pored 
over the book, the more he realized how much was in 
there, not only the handy hints and shortcuts on 
potions that were earning him such a glowing 
reputation with Slughorn, but also the imaginative 
little jinxes and hexes scribbled in the margins, which 
Harry was sure, judging by the crossings-out and 
revisions, that the Prince had invented himself. 

Harry had already attempted a few of the Prince’s self- 
invented spells. There had been a hex that caused 
toenails to grow alarmingly fast (he had tried this on 
Crabbe in the corridor, with very entertaining results); 
a jinx that glued the tongue to the roof of the mouth 
(which he had twice used, to general applause, on an 
unsuspecting Argus Filch); and, perhaps most useful 
of all, Muffliato, a spell that filled the ears of anyone 
nearby with an unidentifiable buzzing, so that lengthy 
conversations could be held in class without being 
overheard. The only person who did not find these 
charms amusing was Hermione, who maintained a 
rigidly disapproving expression throughout and 
refused to talk at all if Harry had used the Muffliato 
spell on anyone in the vicinity. 

Sitting up in bed, Harry turned the book sideways so 
as to examine more closely the scribbled instructions 
for a spell that seemed to have caused the Prince 
some trouble. There were many crossings-out and 
alterations, but finally, crammed into a corner of the 
page, the scribble: 

Levicorpus (nvbl) 

Page | 266 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




While the wind and sleet pounded relentlessly on the 
windows, and Neville snored loudly, Harry stared at 
the letters in brackets. Nvbl ... that had to mean 
“nonverbal.” Harry rather doubted he would be able 
to bring off this particular spell; he was still having 
difficulty with nonverbal spells, something Snape had 
been quick to comment on in every D.A.D.A. class. On 
the other hand, the Prince had proved a much more 
effective teacher than Snape so far. 

Pointing his wand at nothing in particular, he gave it 
an upward flick and said Levicorpusl inside his head. 

“ Aaaaaaaargh ! ” 

There was a flash of light and the room was full of 
voices: Everyone had woken up as Ron had let out a 
yell. Harry sent Advanced Potion-Making flying in 
panic; Ron was dangling upside down in midair as 
though an invisible hook had hoisted him up by the 
ankle. 

“Sorry!” yelled Harry, as Dean and Seamus roared 
with laughter, and Neville picked himself up from the 
floor, having fallen out of bed. “Hang on — I’ll let you 
down — ” 

He groped for the potion book and riffled through it in 
a panic, trying to find the right page; at last he 
located it and deciphered one cramped word 
underneath the spell: Praying that this was the 
counter-jinx, Harry thought Liberacorpus\ with all his 
might. 

There was another flash of light, and Ron fell in a 
heap onto his mattress. 

“Sorry,” repeated Harry weakly, while Dean and 
Seamus continued to roar with laughter. 

Page | 267 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Tomorrow,” said Ron in a muffled voice, “I’d rather 
you set the alarm clock.” 

By the time they had got dressed, padding themselves 
out with several of Mrs. Weasley’s hand-knitted 
sweaters and carrying cloaks, scarves, and gloves, 
Ron’s shock had subsided and he had decided that 
Harry’s new spell was highly amusing; so amusing, in 
fact, that he lost no time in regaling Hermione with 
the story as they sat down for breakfast. 

"... and then there was another flash of light and I 
landed on the bed again!” Ron grinned, helping 
himself to sausages. 

Hermione had not cracked a smile during this 
anecdote, and now turned an expression of wintry 
disapproval upon Harry. 

“Was this spell, by any chance, another one from that 
potion book of yours?” she asked. 

Harry frowned at her. 

“Always jump to the worst conclusion, don’t you?” 
“Was it?” 

“Well ... yeah, it was, but so what?” 

“So you just decided to try out an unknown, 
handwritten incantation and see what would 
happen?” 

“Why does it matter if it’s handwritten?” said Harry, 
preferring not to answer the rest of the question. 

“Because it’s probably not Ministry of Magic- 
approved,” said Hermione. “And also,” she added, as 

Page | 268 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Harry and Ron rolled their eyes, “because I’m starting 
to think this Prince character was a bit dodgy.” 



Both Harry and Ron shouted her down at once. 

“It was a laugh!” said Ron, upending a ketchup bottle 
over his sausages. “Just a laugh, Hermione, that’s 
all!” 

“Dangling people upside down by the ankle?” said 
Hermione. “Who puts their time and energy into 
making up spells like that?” 

“Fred and George,” said Ron, shrugging, “it’s their 
kind of thing. And, er — ” 

“My dad,” said Harry. He had only just remembered. 

“What?” said Ron and Hermione together. 

“My dad used this spell,” said Harry. “I — Lupin told 
me.” 

This last part was not true; in fact, Harry had seen 
his father use the spell on Snape, but he had never 
told Ron and Hermione about that particular 
excursion into the Pensieve. Now, however, a 
wonderful possibility occurred to him. Could the Half- 
Blood Prince possibly be — ? 

“Maybe your dad did use it, Harry,” said Hermione, 
“but he’s not the only one. We’ve seen a whole bunch 
of people use it, in case you’ve forgotten. Dangling 
people in the air. Making them float along, asleep, 
helpless.” 

Harry stared at her. With a sinking feeling, he too 
remembered the behavior of the Death Eaters at the 
Quidditch World Cup. Ron came to his aid. 

Page | 269 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“That was different,” he said robustly. “They were 
abusing it. Harry and his dad were just having a 
laugh. You don’t like the Prince, Hermione,” he added, 
pointing a sausage at her sternly, “because he’s better 
than you at Potions — ” 

“It’s got nothing to do with that!” said Hermione, her 
cheeks reddening. “I just think it’s very irresponsible 
to start performing spells when you don’t even know 
what they’re for, and stop talking about ‘the Prince’ as 
if it’s his title, I bet it’s just a stupid nickname, and it 
doesn’t seem as though he was a very nice person to 
me!” 

“I don’t see where you get that from,” said Harry 
heatedly. “If he’d been a budding Death Eater he 
wouldn’t have been boasting about being ‘half-blood,’ 
would he?” 

Even as he said it, Harry remembered that his father 
had been pure-blood, but he pushed the thought out 
of his mind; he would worry about that later. ... 

“The Death Eaters can’t all be pure-blood, there aren’t 
enough pure-blood wizards left,” said Hermione 
stubbornly. “I expect most of them are half-bloods 
pretending to be pure. It’s only Muggle-borns they 
hate, they’d be quite happy to let you and Ron join 
up.” 

“There is no way they’d let me be a Death Eater!” said 
Ron indignantly, a bit of sausage flying off the fork he 
was now brandishing at Hermione and hitting Ernie 
Macmillan on the head. “My whole family are blood 
traitors! That’s as bad as Muggle-borns to Death 
Eaters!” 



Page | 270 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“And they’d love to have me,” said Harry sarcastically. 
“We’d be best pals if they didn’t keep trying to do me 



in. 






This made Ron laugh; even Hermione gave a grudging 
smile, and a distraction arrived in the shape of Ginny. 

“Hey, Harry, I’m supposed to give you this.” 

It was a scroll of parchment with Harry’s name 
written upon it in familiar thin, slanting writing. 

“Thanks, Ginny ... It’s Dumbledore’s next lesson!” 
Harry told Ron and Hermione, pulling open the 
parchment and quickly reading its contents. “Monday 
evening!” He felt suddenly light and happy. “Want to 
join us in Hogsmeade, Ginny?” he asked. 

“I’m going with Dean — might see you there,” she 
replied, waving at them as she left. 

Filch was standing at the oak front doors as usual, 
checking off the names of people who had permission 
to go into Hogsmeade. The process took even longer 
than normal as Filch was triple-checking everybody 
with his Secrecy Sensor. 

“What does it matter if we’re smuggling Dark stuff 
OUT?” demanded Ron, eyeing the long thin Secrecy 
Sensor with apprehension. “Surely you ought to be 
checking what we bring back IN?” 

His cheek earned him a few extra jabs with the 
Sensor, and he was still wincing as they stepped out 
into the wind and sleet. 

The walk into Hogsmeade was not enjoyable. Harry 
wrapped his scarf over his lower face; the exposed 
part soon felt both raw and numb. The road to the 

Page | 271 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




village was full of students bent double against the 
bitter wind. More than once Harry wondered whether 
they might not have had a better time in the warm 
common room, and when they finally reached 
Hogsmeade and saw that Zonko’s Joke Shop had 
been boarded up, Harry took it as confirmation that 
this trip was not destined to be fun. Ron pointed, with 
a thickly gloved hand, toward Honeydukes, which was 
mercifully open, and Harry and Hermione staggered 
in his wake into the crowded shop. 

“Thank God,” shivered Ron as they were enveloped by 
warm, toffee-scented air. “Let’s stay here all 
afternoon.” 

“Harry, m’boy!” said a booming voice from behind 
them. 

“Oh no,” muttered Harry. The three of them turned to 
see Professor Slughorn, who was wearing an 
enormous furry hat and an overcoat with matching 
fur collar, clutching a large bag of crystalized 
pineapple, and occupying at least a quarter of the 
shop. 

“Harry, that’s three of my little suppers you’ve missed 
now!” said Slughorn, poking him genially in the chest. 
“It won’t do, m’boy, I’m determined to have you! Miss 
Granger loves them, don’t you?” 

“Yes,” said Hermione helplessly, “they’re really — ” 

“So why don’t you come along, Harry?” demanded 
Slughorn. 

“Well, I’ve had Quidditch practice, Professor,” said 
Harry, who had indeed been scheduling practices 
every time Slughorn had sent him a little, violet 
ribbon-adorned invitation. This strategy meant that 

Page | 272 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Ron was not left out, and they usually had a laugh 
with Ginny, imagining Hermione shut up with 
McLaggen and Zabini. 

“Well, I certainly expect you to win your first match 
after all this hard work!” said Slughorn. “But a little 
recreation never hurt anybody. Now, how about 
Monday night, you can’t possibly want to practice in 
this weather. ...” 

“I can’t, Professor, I’ve got — er — an appointment 
with Professor Dumbledore that evening.” 

“Unlucky again!” cried Slughorn dramatically. “Ah, 
well ... you can’t evade me forever, Harry!” 

And with a regal wave, he waddled out of the shop, 
taking as little notice of Ron as though he had been a 
display of Cockroach Clusters. 

“I can’t believe you’ve wriggled out of another one,” 
said Hermione, shaking her head. “They’re not that 
bad, you know. ... They’re even quite fun sometimes. 
...” But then she caught sight of Ron’s expression. 

“Oh, look — they’ve got deluxe sugar quills — those 
would last hours!” 

Glad that Hermione had changed the subject, Harry 
showed much more interest in the new extra-large 
sugar quills than he would normally have done, but 
Ron continued to look moody and merely shrugged 
when Hermione asked him where he wanted to go 
next. 

“Let’s go to the Three Broomsticks,” said Harry. “It’ll 
be warm.” 

They bundled their scarves back over their faces and 
left the sweetshop. The bitter wind was like knives on 

Page | 273 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




their faces after the sugary warmth of Honeydukes. 
The street was not very busy; nobody was lingering to 
chat, just hurrying toward their destinations. The 
exceptions were two men a little ahead of them, 
standing just outside the Three Broomsticks. One was 
very tall and thin; squinting through his rain-washed 
glasses Harry recognized the barman who worked in 
the other Hogsmeade pub, the Hog’s Head. As Harry, 
Ron, and Hermione drew closer, the barman drew his 
cloak more tightly around his neck and walked away, 
leaving the shorter man to fumble with something in 
his arms. They were barely feet from him when Harry 
realized who the man was. 

“Mundungus!” 

The squat, bandy-legged man with long, straggly, 
ginger hair jumped and dropped an ancient suitcase, 
which burst open, releasing what looked like the 
entire contents of a junk shop window. 

“Oh, ’ello, ’Arry,” said Mundungus Fletcher, with a 
most unconvincing stab at airiness. “Well, don’t let 
me keep ya.” 

And he began scrabbling on the ground to retrieve the 
contents of his suitcase with every appearance of a 
man eager to be gone. 

“Are you selling this stuff?” asked Harry, watching 
Mundungus grab an assortment of grubby-looking 
objects from the ground. 

“Oh, well, gotta scrape a living,” said Mundungus. 
“Gimme that!” 

Ron had stooped down and picked up something 
silver.

“Hang on,” Ron said slowly. “This looks familiar — ” 



“Thank you!” said Mundungus, snatching the goblet 
out of Ron’s hand and stuffing it back into the case. 
“Well, I’ll see you all — OUCH!” 

Harry had pinned Mundungus against the wall of the 
pub by the throat. Holding him fast with one hand, he 
pulled out his wand. 

“Harry!” squealed Hermione. 

“You took that from Sirius’s house,” said Harry, who 
was almost nose to nose with Mundungus and was 
breathing in an unpleasant smell of old tobacco and 
spirits. “That had the Black family crest on it.” 

“I — no — what — ?” spluttered Mundungus, who 
was slowly turning purple. 

“What did you do, go back the night he died and strip 
the place?” snarled Harry. 

“I — no — ” 

“Give it to me!” 

“Harry, you mustn’t!” shrieked Hermione, as 
Mundungus started to turn blue. 

There was a bang, and Harry felt his hands fly off 
Mundungus’s throat. Gasping and spluttering, 
Mundungus seized his fallen case, then — CRACK — 
he Disapparated. 

Harry swore at the top of his voice, spinning on the 
spot to see where Mundungus had gone. 

“COME BACK, YOU THIEVING — !” 

Page | 275 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“There’s no point, Harry.” 



Tonks had appeared out of nowhere, her mousy hair 
wet with sleet. 

“Mundungus will probably be in London by now. 
There’s no point yelling.” 

“He’s nicked Sirius’s stuff! Nicked it!” 

“Yes, but still,” said Tonks, who seemed perfectly 
untroubled by this piece of information. “You should 
get out of the cold.” 

She watched them go through the door of the Three 
Broomsticks. 

The moment he was inside, Harry burst out, “He was 
nicking Sirius’s stuff.” 

“I know, Harry, but please don’t shout, people are 
staring,” whispered Hermione. “Go and sit down, I’ll 
get you a drink.” 

Harry was still fuming when Hermione returned to 
their table a few minutes later holding three bottles of 
butterbeer. 

“Can’t the Order control Mundungus?” Harry 
demanded of the other two in a furious whisper. 

“Can’t they at least stop him stealing everything that’s 
not fixed down when he’s at headquarters?” 

“Shh!” said Hermione desperately, looking around to 
make sure nobody was listening; there were a couple 
of warlocks sitting close by who were staring at Harry 
with great interest, and Zabini was lolling against a 
pillar not far away. “Harry, I’d be annoyed too, I know 
it’s your things he’s stealing — ” 

Page | 276 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Harry gagged on his butterbeer; he had momentarily 
forgotten that he owned number twelve, Grimmauld 
Place. 

“Yeah, it’s my stuff!” he said. “No wonder he wasn’t 
pleased to see me! Well, I’m going to tell Dumbledore 
what’s going on, he’s the only one who scares 
Mundungus.” 

“Good idea,” whispered Hermione, clearly pleased that 
Harry was calming down. “Ron, what are you staring 
at?” 

“Nothing,” said Ron, hastily looking away from the 
bar, but Harry knew he was trying to catch the eye of 
the curvy and attractive barmaid, Madam Rosmerta, 
for whom he had long nursed a soft spot. 

“I expect ‘nothing’s’ in the back getting more 
firewhisky,” said Hermione waspishly. 

Ron ignored this jibe, sipping his drink in what he 
evidently considered to be a dignified silence. Harry 
was thinking about Sirius, and how he had hated 
those silver goblets anyway. Hermione drummed her 
fingers on the table, her eyes flickering between Ron 
and the bar. The moment Harry drained the last 
drops in his bottle she said, “Shall we call it a day 
and go back to school, then?” 

The other two nodded; it had not been a fun trip and 
the weather was getting worse the longer they stayed. 
Once again they drew their cloaks tightly around 
them, rearranged their scarves, pulled on their gloves, 
then followed Katie Bell and a friend out of the pub 
and back up the High Street. Harry’s thoughts 
strayed to Ginny as they trudged up the road to 
Hogwarts through the frozen slush. They had not met 
up with her, undoubtedly, thought Harry, because 
Page | 277 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




she and Dean were cozily closeted in Madam 
Puddifoot’s Tea Shop, that haunt of happy couples. 
Scowling, he bowed his head against the swirling sleet 
and trudged on. 

It was a little while before Harry became aware that 
the voices of Katie Bell and her friend, which were 
being carried back to him on the wind, had become 
shriller and louder. Harry squinted at their indistinct 
figures. The two girls were having an argument about 
something Katie was holding in her hand. “It’s 
nothing to do with you, Leanne!” Harry heard Katie 
say. 

They rounded a corner in the lane, sleet coming thick 
and fast, blurring Harry’s glasses. Just as he raised a 
gloved hand to wipe them, Leanne made to grab hold 
of the package Katie was holding; Katie tugged it back 
and the package fell to the ground. 

At once, Katie rose into the air, not as Ron had done, 
suspended comically by the ankle, but gracefully, her 
arms outstretched, as though she was about to fly. 

Yet there was something wrong, something eerie. ... 
Her hair was whipped around her by the fierce wind, 
but her eyes were closed and her face was quite 
empty of expression. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and 
Leanne had all halted in their tracks, watching. 

Then, six feet above the ground, Katie let out a 
terrible scream. Her eyes flew open but whatever she 
could see, or whatever she was feeling, was clearly 
causing her terrible anguish. She screamed and 
screamed; Leanne started to scream too and seized 
Katie’s ankles, trying to tug her back to the ground. 
Harry, Ron, and Hermione rushed forward to help, 
but even as they grabbed Katie’s legs, she fell on top 
of them; Harry and Ron managed to catch her but she 
was writhing so much they could hardly hold her. 
Page | 278 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Instead they lowered her to the ground where she 
thrashed and screamed, apparently unable to 
recognize any of them. 

Harry looked around; the landscape seemed deserted. 

“Stay there!” he shouted at the others over the 
howling wind. “I’m going for help!” 

He began to sprint toward the school; he had never 
seen anyone behave as Katie had just behaved and 
could not think what had caused it; he hurtled 
around a bend in the lane and collided with what 
seemed to be an enormous bear on its hind legs. 

“Hagrid!” he panted, disentangling himself from the 
hedgerow into which he had fallen. 

“Harry!” said Hagrid, who had sleet trapped in his 
eyebrows and beard, and was wearing his great, 
shaggy beaverskin coat. “Jus’ bin visitin’ Grawp, he’s 
cornin’ on so well yeh wouldn’ — ” 

“Hagrid, someone’s hurt back there, or cursed, or 
something — ” 

“Wha?” said Hagrid, bending lower to hear what 
Harry was saying over the raging wind. 

“Someone’s been cursed!” bellowed Harry. 

“Cursed? Who’s bin cursed — not Ron? Hermione?” 

“No, it’s not them, it’s Katie Bell — this way ...” 

Together they ran back along the lane. It took them 
no time to find the little group of people around Katie, 
who was still writhing and screaming on the ground; 



Page | 279 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Ron, Hermione, and Leanne were all trying to quiet 
her. 

“Get back!” shouted Hagrid. “Lemme see her!” 

“Something’s happened to her!” sobbed Leanne. “I 
don’t know what — ” 

Hagrid stared at Katie for a second, then without a 
word, bent down, scooped her into his arms, and ran 
off toward the castle with her. Within seconds, Katie’s 
piercing screams had died away and the only sound 
was the roar of the wind. 

Hermione hurried over to Katie’s wailing friend and 
put an arm around her. 

“It’s Leanne, isn’t it?” 

The girl nodded. 

“Did it just happen all of a sudden, or — ?” 

“It was when that package tore,” sobbed Leanne, 
pointing at the now sodden brown-paper package on 
the ground, which had split open to reveal a greenish 
glitter. Ron bent down, his hand outstretched, but 
Harry seized his arm and pulled him back. 

“Don’t touch if!” 

He crouched down. An ornate opal necklace was 
visible, poking out of the paper. 

“I’ve seen that before,” said Harry, staring at the 
thing. “It was on display in Borgin and Burkes ages 
ago. The label said it was cursed. Katie must have 
touched it.” He looked up at Leanne, who had started 



Page | 280 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




to shake uncontrollably. “How did Katie get hold of 
this?” 



“Well, that’s why we were arguing. She came back 
from the bathroom in the Three Broomsticks holding 
it, said it was a surprise for somebody at Hogwarts 
and she had to deliver it. She looked all funny when 
she said it. ... Oh no, oh no, I bet she’d been 
Imperiused and I didn’t realize!” 

Leanne shook with renewed sobs. Hermione patted 
her shoulder gently. 

“She didn’t say who’d given it to her, Leanne?” 

“No ... she wouldn’t tell me ... and I said she was 
being stupid and not to take it up to school, but she 
just wouldn’t listen and ... and then I tried to grab it 
from her . . . and — and — ” 

Leanne let out a wail of despair. 

“We’d better get up to school,” said Hermione, her 
arm still around Leanne. “We’ll be able to find out 
how she is. Come on. ...” 

Harry hesitated for a moment, then pulled his scarf 
from around his face and, ignoring Ron’s gasp, 
carefully covered the necklace in it and picked it up. 

“Well need to show this to Madam Pomfrey,” he said. 

As they followed Hermione and Leanne up the road, 
Harry was thinking furiously. They had just entered 
the grounds when he spoke, unable to keep his 
thoughts to himself any longer. 

“Malfoy knows about this necklace. It was in a case at 
Borgin and Burkes four years ago, I saw him having a 

Page | 281 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




good look at it while I was hiding from him and his 
dad. This is what he was buying that day when we 
followed him! He remembered it and he went back for 
it!” 



“I — I dunno, Harry,” said Ron hesitantly. “Loads of 
people go to Borgin and Burkes ... and didn’t that girl 
say Katie got it in the girls’ bathroom?” 

“She said she came back from the bathroom with it, 
she didn’t necessarily get it in the bathroom itself — ” 

“McGonagall!” said Ron warningly. 

Harry looked up. Sure enough, Professor McGonagall 
was hurrying down the stone steps through swirling 
sleet to meet them. 

“Hagrid says you four saw what happened to Katie 
Bell — upstairs to my office at once, please! What’s 
that you’re holding, Potter?” 

“It’s the thing she touched,” said Harry. 

“Good lord,” said Professor McGonagall, looking 
alarmed as she took the necklace from Harry. “No, no, 
Filch, they’re with me!” she added hastily, as Filch 
came shuffling eagerly across the entrance hall 
holding his Secrecy Sensor aloft. “Take this necklace 
to Professor Snape at once, but be sure not to touch 
it, keep it wrapped in the scarf!” 

Harry and the others followed Professor McGonagall 
upstairs and into her office. The sleet-spattered 
windows were rattling in their frames, and the room 
was chilly despite the fire crackling in the grate. 
Professor McGonagall closed the door and swept 
around her desk to face Harry, Ron, Hermione, and 
the still sobbing Leanne. 

Page | 282 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Well?” she said sharply. “What happened?” 



Haltingly, and with many pauses while she attempted 
to control her crying, Leanne told Professor 
McGonagall how Katie had gone to the bathroom in 
the Three Broomsticks and returned holding the 
unmarked package, how Katie had seemed a little 
odd, and how they had argued about the advisability 
of agreeing to deliver unknown objects, the argument 
culminating in the tussle over the parcel, which tore 
open. At this point, Leanne was so overcome, there 
was no getting another word out of her. 

“All right,” said Professor McGonagall, not unkindly, 
“go up to the hospital wing, please, Leanne, and get 
Madam Pomfrey to give you something for shock.” 

When she had left the room, Professor McGonagall 
turned back to Harry, Ron, and Hermione. 

“What happened when Katie touched the necklace?” 

“She rose up in the air,” said Harry, before either Ron 
or Hermione could speak, “and then began to scream, 
and collapsed. Professor, can I see Professor 
Dumbledore, please?” 

“The headmaster is away until Monday, Potter,” said 
Professor McGonagall, looking surprised. 

“Away?” Harry repeated angrily. 

“Yes, Potter, away!” said Professor McGonagall tartly. 
“But anything you have to say about this horrible 
business can be said to me, I’m sure!” 

For a split second, Harry hesitated. Professor 
McGonagall did not invite confidences; Dumbledore, 
though in many ways more intimidating, still seemed 

Page | 283 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




less likely to scorn a theory, however wild. This was a 
life-and-death matter, though, and no moment to 
worry about being laughed at. 

“I think Draco Malfoy gave Katie that necklace, 
Professor.” 

On one side of him, Ron rubbed his nose in apparent 
embarrassment; on the other, Hermione shuffled her 
feet as though quite keen to put a bit of distance 
between herself and Harry. 

“That is a very serious accusation, Potter,” said 
Professor McGonagall, after a shocked pause. “Do you 
have any proof?” 

“No,” said Harry, “but ...” and he told her about 
following Malfoy to Borgin and Burkes and the 
conversation they had overheard between him and 
Mr. Borgin. 

When he had finished speaking, Professor 
McGonagall looked slightly confused. 

“Malfoy took something to Borgin and Burkes for 
repair?” 

“No, Professor, he just wanted Borgin to tell him how 
to mend something, he didn’t have it with him. But 
that’s not the point, the thing is that he bought 
something at the same time, and I think it was that 
necklace — ” 

“You saw Malfoy leaving the shop with a similar 
package?” 

“No, Professor, he told Borgin to keep it in the shop 
for him — ” 



Page | 284 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“But Harry,” Hermione interrupted, “Borgin asked 
him if he wanted to take it with him, and Malfoy said 



no — 






“Because he didn’t want to touch it, obviously!” said 
Harry angrily. 

“What he actually said was, ‘How would I look 
carrying that down the street?’ ” said Hermione. 

“Well, he would look a bit of a prat carrying a 
necklace,” interjected Ron. 

“Oh, Ron,” said Hermione despairingly, “it would be 
all wrapped up, so he wouldn’t have to touch it, and 
quite easy to hide inside a cloak, so nobody would see 
it! I think whatever he reserved at Borgin and Burkes 
was noisy or bulky, something he knew would draw 
attention to him if he carried it down the street — and 
in any case,” she pressed on loudly, before Harry 
could interrupt, “I asked Borgin about the necklace, 
don’t you remember? When I went in to try and find 
out what Malfoy had asked him to keep, I saw it 
there. And Borgin just told me the price, he didn’t say 
it was already sold or anything — ” 

“Well, you were being really obvious, he realized what 
you were up to within about five seconds, of course 
he wasn’t going to tell you — anyway, Malfoy could’ve 
sent off for it since — ” 

“That’s enough!” said Professor McGonagall, as 
Hermione opened her mouth to retort, looking 
furious. “Potter, I appreciate you telling me this, but 
we cannot point the finger of blame at Mr. Malfoy 
purely because he visited the shop where this 
necklace might have been purchased. The same is 
probably true of hundreds of people — ” 



Page | 285 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“ — that’s what I said — ” muttered Ron. 



“ — and in any case, we have put stringent security 
measures in place this year. I do not believe that 
necklace can possibly have entered this school 
without our knowledge — ” 

“But — ” 

“ — and what is more,” said Professor McGonagall, 
with an air of awful finality, “Mr. Malfoy was not in 
Hogsmeade today.” 

Harry gaped at her, deflating. 

“How do you know, Professor?” 

“Because he was doing detention with me. He has 
now failed to complete his Transfiguration homework 
twice in a row. So, thank you for telling me your 
suspicions, Potter,” she said as she marched past 
them, “but I need to go up to the hospital wing now to 
check on Katie Bell. Good day to you all.” 

She held open her office door. They had no choice but 
to file past her without another word. 

Harry was angry with the other two for siding with 
McGonagall; nevertheless, he felt compelled to join in 
once they started discussing what had happened. 

“So who do you reckon Katie was supposed to give the 
necklace to?” asked Ron, as they climbed the stairs to 
the common room. 

“Goodness only knows,” said Hermione. “But whoever 
it was has had a narrow escape. No one could have 
opened that package without touching the necklace.” 



Page | 286 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“It could’ve been meant for loads of people,” said 
Harry. “Dumbledore — the Death Eaters would love to 
get rid of him, he must be one of their top targets. Or 
Slughorn — Dumbledore reckons Voldemort really 
wanted him and they can’t be pleased that he’s sided 
with Dumbledore. Or — ” 

“Or you,” said Hermione, looking troubled. 

“Couldn’t have been,” said Harry, “or Katie would’ve 
just turned around in the lane and given it to me, 
wouldn’t she? I was behind her all the way out of the 
Three Broomsticks. It would have made much more 
sense to deliver the parcel outside Hogwarts, what 
with Filch searching everyone who goes in and out. I 
wonder why Malfoy told her to take it into the castle?” 

“Harry, Malfoy wasn’t in Hogsmeade!” said Hermione, 
actually stamping her foot in frustration. 

“He must have used an accomplice, then,” said Harry. 
“Crabbe or Goyle — or, come to think of it, another 
Death Eater, he’ll have loads better cronies than 
Crabbe and Goyle now he’s joined up — ” 

Ron and Hermione exchanged looks that plainly said 
There’s no point arguing with him. 

“Dilligrout,” said Hermione firmly as they reached the 
Fat Lady. 

The portrait swung open to admit them to the 
common room. It was quite full and smelled of damp 
clothing; many people seemed to have returned from 
Hogsmeade early because of the bad weather. There 
was no buzz of fear or speculation, however: Clearly, 
the news of Katie’s fate had not yet spread. 



Page | 287 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“It wasn’t a very slick attack, really, when you stop 
and think about it,” said Ron, casually turfing a first 
year out of one of the good armchairs by the fire so 
that he could sit down. “The curse didn’t even make it 
into the castle. Not what you’d call foolproof.” 

“You’re right,” said Hermione, prodding Ron out of the 
chair with her foot and offering it to the first year 
again. “It wasn’t very well thought-out at all.” 

“But since when has Malfoy been one of the world’s 
great thinkers?” asked Harry. 

Neither Ron nor Hermione answered him. 



Page | 288 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 






THE SECRET RIDDLE 

Katie was removed to St. Mungo’s Hospital for 
Magical Maladies and Injuries the following day, by 
which time the news that she had been cursed had 
spread all over the school, though the details were 
confused and nobody other than Harry, Ron, 
Hermione, and Leanne seemed to know that Katie 
herself had not been the intended target. 

“Oh, and Malfoy knows, of course,” said Harry to Ron 
and Hermione, who continued their new policy of 
feigning deafness whenever Harry mentioned his 
Malfoy-Is-a-Death-Eater theory. 

Harry had wondered whether Dumbledore would 
return from wherever he had been in time for Monday 
night’s lesson, but having had no word to the 
contrary, he presented himself outside Dumbledore ’s 
office at eight o’clock, knocked, and was told to enter. 
There sat Dumbledore looking unusually tired; his 
hand was as black and burned as ever, but he smiled 
when he gestured to Harry to sit down. The Pensieve 



Page | 289 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 



was sitting on the desk again, casting silvery specks 
of light over the ceiling. 



“You have had a busy time while I have been away,” 
Dumbledore said. “I believe you witnessed Katie’s 
accident.” 

“Yes, sir. How is she?” 

“Still very unwell, although she was relatively lucky. 
She appears to have brushed the necklace with the 
smallest possible amount of skin: There was a tiny 
hole in her glove. Had she put it on, had she even 
held it in her ungloved hand, she would have died, 
perhaps instantly. Luckily Professor Snape was able 
to do enough to prevent a rapid spread of the curse — 



“Why him?” asked Harry quickly. “Why not Madam 
Pomfrey?” 

“Impertinent,” said a soft voice from one of the 
portraits on the wall, and Phineas Nigellus Black, 
Sirius’s great-great-grandfather, raised his head from 
his arms where he had appeared to be sleeping. “I 
would not have permitted a student to question the 
way Hogwarts operated in my day.” 

“Yes, thank you, Phineas,” said Dumbledore 
quellingly. “Professor Snape knows much more about 
the Dark Arts than Madam Pomfrey, Harry. Anyway, 
the St. Mungo’s staff are sending me hourly reports, 
and I am hopeful that Katie will make a full recovery 
in time.” 

“Where were you this weekend, sir?” Harry asked, 
disregarding a strong feeling that he might be 
pushing his luck, a feeling apparently shared by 
Phineas Nigellus, who hissed softly. 

Page | 290 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“I would rather not say just now,” said Dumbledore. 
“However, I shall tell you in due course.” 

“You will?” said Harry, startled. 

“Yes, I expect so,” said Dumbledore, withdrawing a 
fresh bottle of silver memories from inside his robes 
and uncorking it with a prod of his wand. 

“Sir,” said Harry tentatively, “I met Mundungus in 
Hogsmeade.” 

“Ah yes, I am already aware that Mundungus has 
been treating your inheritance with light-fingered 
contempt,” said Dumbledore, frowning a little. “He 
has gone to ground since you accosted him outside 
the Three Broomsticks; I rather think he dreads 
facing me. However, rest assured that he will not be 
making away with any more of Sirius’s old 
possessions.” 

“That mangy old half-blood has been stealing Black 
heirlooms?” said Phineas Nigellus, incensed; and he 
stalked out of his frame, undoubtedly to visit his 
portrait in number twelve, Grimmauld Place. 

“Professor,” said Harry, after a short pause, “did 
Professor McGonagall tell you what I told her after 
Katie got hurt? About Draco Malfoy?” 

“She told me of your suspicions, yes,” said 
Dumbledore. 

“And do you — ?” 

“I shall take all appropriate measures to investigate 
anyone who might have had a hand in Katie’s 
accident,” said Dumbledore. “But what concerns me 
now, Harry, is our lesson.” 

Page | 291 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Harry felt slightly resentful at this: If their lessons 
were so very important, why had there been such a 
long gap between the first and second? However, he 
said no more about Draco Malfoy, but watched as 
Dumbledore poured the fresh memories into the 
Pensieve and began swirling the stone basin once 
more between his long-fingered hands. 

“You will remember, I am sure, that we left the tale of 
Lord Voldemort’s beginnings at the point where the 
handsome Muggle, Tom Riddle, had abandoned his 
witch wife, Merope, and returned to his family home 
in Little Hangleton. Merope was left alone in London, 
expecting the baby who would one day become Lord 
Voldemort.” 

“How do you know she was in London, sir?” 

“Because of the evidence of one Caractacus Burke,” 
said Dumbledore, “who, by an odd coincidence, 
helped found the very shop whence came the 
necklace we have just been discussing.” 

He swilled the contents of the Pensieve as Harry had 
seen him swill them before, much as a gold 
prospector sifts for gold. Up out of the swirling, silvery 
mass rose a little old man revolving slowly in the 
Pensieve, silver as a ghost but much more solid, with 
a thatch of hair that completely covered his eyes. 

“Yes, we acquired it in curious circumstances. It was 
brought in by a young witch just before Christmas, 
oh, many years ago now. She said she needed the 
gold badly, well, that much was obvious. Covered in 
rags and pretty far along ... Going to have a baby, see. 
She said the locket had been Slytherin’s. Well, we 
hear that sort of story all the time, ‘Oh, this was 
Merlin’s, this was, his favorite teapot,’ but when I 
looked at it, it had his mark all right, and a few 
Page | 292 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




simple spells were enough to tell me the truth. Of 
course, that made it near enough priceless. She didn’t 
seem to have any idea how much it was worth. Happy 
to get ten Galleons for it. Best bargain we ever made!” 

Dumbledore gave the Pensieve an extra-vigorous 
shake and Caractacus Burke descended back into the 
swirling mass of memory from whence he had come. 

“He only gave her ten Galleons?” said Harry 
indignantly. 

“Caractacus Burke was not famed for his generosity,” 
said Dumbledore. “So we know that, near the end of 
her pregnancy, Merope was alone in London and in 
desperate need of gold, desperate enough to sell her 
one and only valuable possession, the locket that was 
one of Marvolo’s treasured family heirlooms.” 

“But she could do magic!” said Harry impatiently. 

“She could have got food and everything for herself by 
magic, couldn’t she?” 

“Ah,” said Dumbledore, “perhaps she could. But it is 
my belief — I am guessing again, but I am sure I am 
right — that when her husband abandoned her, 
Merope stopped using magic. I do not think that she 
wanted to be a witch any longer. Of course, it is also 
possible that her unrequited love and the attendant 
despair sapped her of her powers; that can happen. 

In any case, as you are about to see, Merope refused 
to raise her wand even to save her own life.” 

“She wouldn’t even stay alive for her son?” 

Dumbledore raised his eyebrows. “Could you possibly 
be feeling sorry for Lord Voldemort?”

“No,” said Harry quickly, “but she had a choice, didn’t 
she, not like my mother — ” 

“Your mother had a choice too,” said Dumbledore 
gently. “Yes, Merope Riddle chose death in spite of a 
son who needed her, but do not judge her too 
harshly, Harry. She was greatly weakened by long 
suffering and she never had your mother’s courage. 
And now, if you will stand ...” 

“Where are we going?” Harry asked, as Dumbledore 
joined him at the front of the desk. 

“This time,” said Dumbledore, “we are going to enter 
my memory. I think you will find it both rich in detail 
and satisfyingly accurate. After you, Harry ...” 

Harry bent over the Pensieve; his face broke the cool 
surface of the memory and then he was falling 
through darkness again. ... Seconds later, his feet hit 
firm ground; he opened his eyes and found that he 
and Dumbledore were standing in a bustling, old- 
fashioned London street. 

“There I am,” said Dumbledore brightly, pointing 
ahead of them to a tall figure crossing the road in 
front of a horse-drawn milk cart. 

This younger Albus Dumbledore ’s long hair and beard 
were auburn. Having reached their side of the street, 
he strode off along the pavement, drawing many 
curious glances due to the flamboyantly cut suit of 
plum velvet that he was wearing. 

“Nice suit, sir,” said Harry, before he could stop 
himself, but Dumbledore merely chuckled as they 
followed his younger self a short distance, finally 
passing through a set of iron gates into a bare 
courtyard that fronted a rather grim, square building 
Page | 294 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




surrounded by high railings. He mounted the few 
steps leading to the front door and knocked once. 
After a moment or two, the door was opened by a 
scruffy girl wearing an apron. 

“Good afternoon. I have an appointment with a Mrs. 
Cole, who, I believe, is the matron here?” 

“Oh,” said the bewildered-looking girl, taking in 
Dumbledore ’s eccentric appearance. “Um ... just a 
mo’ ... MRS. COLE!” she bellowed over her shoulder. 

Harry heard a distant voice shouting something in 
response. The girl turned back to Dumbledore. “Come 
in, she’s on ’er way.” 

Dumbledore stepped into a hallway tiled in black and 
white; the whole place was shabby but spotlessly 
clean. Harry and the older Dumbledore followed. 
Before the front door had closed behind them, a 
skinny, harassed-looking woman came scurrying 
toward them. She had a sharp-featured face that 
appeared more anxious than unkind, and she was 
talking over her shoulder to another aproned helper 
as she walked toward Dumbledore. 

"... and take the iodine upstairs to Martha, Billy 
Stubbs has been picking his scabs and Eric Whalley’s 
oozing all over his sheets — chicken pox on top of 
everything else,” she said to nobody in particular, and 
then her eyes fell upon Dumbledore and she stopped 
dead in her tracks, looking as astonished as if a 
giraffe had just crossed her threshold. 

“Good afternoon,” said Dumbledore, holding out his 
hand. 

Mrs. Cole simply gaped. 



Page | 295 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“My name is Albus Dumbledore. I sent you a letter 
requesting an appointment and you very kindly 
invited me here today.” 

Mrs. Cole blinked. Apparently deciding that 
Dumbledore was not a hallucination, she said feebly, 
“Oh yes. Well — well then — you’d better come into 
my room. Yes.” 

She led Dumbledore into a small room that seemed 
part sitting room, part office. It was as shabby as the 
hallway and the furniture was old and mismatched. 
She invited Dumbledore to sit on a rickety chair and 
seated herself behind a cluttered desk, eyeing him 
nervously. 

“I am here, as I told you in my letter, to discuss Tom 
Riddle and arrangements for his future,” said 
Dumbledore. 

“Are you family?” asked Mrs. Cole. 

“No, I am a teacher,” said Dumbledore. “I have come 
to offer Tom a place at my school.” 

“What school’s this, then?” 

“It is called Hogwarts,” said Dumbledore. 

“And how come you’re interested in Tom?” 

“We believe he has qualities we are looking for.” 

“You mean he’s won a scholarship? How can he have 
done? He’s never been entered for one.” 

“Well, his name has been down for our school since 
birth — ” 



Page | 296 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Who registered him? His parents?” 



There was no doubt that Mrs. Cole was an 
inconveniently sharp woman. Apparently Dumbledore 
thought so too, for Harry now saw him slip his wand 
out of the pocket of his velvet suit, at the same time 
picking up a piece of perfectly blank paper from Mrs. 
Cole’s desktop. 

“Here,” said Dumbledore, waving his wand once as he 
passed her the piece of paper, “I think this will make 
everything clear.” 

Mrs. Cole’s eyes slid out of focus and back again as 
she gazed intently at the blank paper for a moment. 

“That seems perfectly in order,” she said placidly, 
handing it back. Then her eyes fell upon a bottle of 
gin and two glasses that had certainly not been 
present a few seconds before. 

“Er — may I offer you a glass of gin?” she said in an 
extra-refined voice. 

“Thank you very much,” said Dumbledore, beaming. 

It soon became clear that Mrs. Cole was no novice 
when it came to gin drinking. Pouring both of them a 
generous measure, she drained her own glass in one 
gulp. Smacking her lips frankly, she smiled at 
Dumbledore for the first time, and he didn’t hesitate 
to press his advantage. 

“I was wondering whether you could tell me anything 
of Tom Riddle’s history? I think he was born here in 
the orphanage?” 

“That’s right,” said Mrs. Cole, helping herself to more 
gin. “I remember it clear as anything, because I’d just 

Page | 297 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




started here myself. New Year’s Eve and bitter cold, 
snowing, you know. Nasty night. And this girl, not 
much older than I was myself at the time, came 
staggering up the front steps. Well, she wasn’t the 
first. We took her in, and she had the baby within the 
hour. And she was dead in another hour.” 

Mrs. Cole nodded impressively and took another 
generous gulp of gin. 

“Did she say anything before she died?” asked 
Dumbledore. “Anything about the boy’s father, for 
instance?” 

“Now, as it happens, she did,” said Mrs. Cole, who 
seemed to be rather enjoying herself now, with the gin 
in her hand and an eager audience for her story. “I 
remember she said to me, ‘I hope he looks like his 
papa,’ and I won’t lie, she was right to hope it, 
because she was no beauty — and then she told me 
he was to be named Tom, for his father, and Marvolo, 
for her father — yes, I know, funny name, isn’t it? We 
wondered whether she came from a circus — and she 
said the boy’s surname was to be Riddle. And she 
died soon after that without another word. 

“Well, we named him just as she’d said, it seemed so 
important to the poor girl, but no Tom nor Marvolo 
nor any kind of Riddle ever came looking for him, nor 
any family at all, so he stayed in the orphanage and 
he’s been here ever since.” 

Mrs. Cole helped herself, almost absentmindedly, to 
another healthy measure of gin. Two pink spots had 
appeared high on her cheekbones. Then she said, 
“He’s a funny boy.” 

“Yes,” said Dumbledore. “I thought he might be.” 



Page | 298 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“He was a funny baby too. He hardly ever cried, you 
know. And then, when he got a little older, he was . . . 
odd.” 



“Odd in what way?” asked Dumbledore gently. 

“Well, he — ” 

But Mrs. Cole pulled up short, and there was nothing 
blurry or vague about the inquisitorial glance she 
shot Dumbledore over her gin glass. 

“He’s definitely got a place at your school, you say?” 

“Definitely,” said Dumbledore. 

“And nothing I say can change that?” 

“Nothing,” said Dumbledore. 

“You’ll be taking him away, whatever?” 

“Whatever,” repeated Dumbledore gravely. 

She squinted at him as though deciding whether or 
not to trust him. Apparently she decided she could, 
because she said in a sudden rush, “He scares the 
other children.” 

“You mean he is a bully?” asked Dumbledore. 

“I think he must be,” said Mrs. Cole, frowning 
slightly, “but it’s very hard to catch him at it. There 
have been incidents. ... Nasty things ...” 

Dumbledore did not press her, though Harry could 
tell that he was interested. She took yet another gulp 
of gin and her rosy cheeks grew rosier still. 

Page | 299 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Billy Stubbs’s rabbit ... well, Tom said he didn’t do it 
and I don’t see how he could have done, but even so, 
it didn’t hang itself from the rafters, did it?” 

“I shouldn’t think so, no,” said Dumbledore quietly. 

“But I’m jiggered if I know how he got up there to do 
it. All I know is he and Billy had argued the day 
before. And then” — Mrs. Cole took another swig of 
gin, slopping a little over her chin this time — “on the 
summer outing — we take them out, you know, once 
a year, to the countryside or to the seaside — well, 
Amy Benson and Dennis Bishop were never quite 
right afterwards, and all we ever got out of them was 
that they’d gone into a cave with Tom Riddle. He 
swore they’d just gone exploring, but something 
happened in there, I’m sure of it. And, well, there 
have been a lot of things, funny things. ...” 

She looked around at Dumbledore again, and though 
her cheeks were flushed, her gaze was steady. “I don’t 
think many people will be sorry to see the back of 
him.” 

“You understand, I’m sure, that we will not be 
keeping him permanently?” said Dumbledore. “He will 
have to return here, at the very least, every summer.” 

“Oh, well, that’s better than a whack on the nose with 
a rusty poker,” said Mrs. Cole with a slight hiccup. 

She got to her feet, and Harry was impressed to see 
that she was quite steady, even though two-thirds of 
the gin was now gone. “I suppose you’d like to see 
him?” 

“Very much,” said Dumbledore, rising too. 

She led him out of her office and up the stone stairs, 
calling out instructions and admonitions to helpers 

Page | 300 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




and children as she passed. The orphans, Harry saw, 
were all wearing the same kind of grayish tunic. They 
looked reasonably well-cared for, but there was no 
denying that this was a grim place in which to grow 
up. 

“Here we are,” said Mrs. Cole, as they turned off the 
second landing and stopped outside the first door in a 
long corridor. She knocked twice and entered. 

“Tom? You’ve got a visitor. This is Mr. Dumberton — 
sorry, Dunderbore. He’s come to tell you — well, I’ll 
let him do it.” 

Harry and the two Dumbledores entered the room, 
and Mrs. Cole closed the door on them. It was a small 
bare room with nothing in it except an old wardrobe, 
a wooden chair, and an iron bedstead. A boy was 
sitting on top of the gray blankets, his legs stretched 
out in front of him, holding a book. 

There was no trace of the Gaunts in Tom Riddle’s 
face. Merope had got her dying wish: He was his 
handsome father in miniature, tall for eleven years 
old, dark-haired, and pale. His eyes narrowed slightly 
as he took in Dumbledore’s eccentric appearance. 
There was a moment’s silence. 

“How do you do, Tom?” said Dumbledore, walking 
forward and holding out his hand. 

The boy hesitated, then took it, and they shook 
hands. Dumbledore drew up the hard wooden chair 
beside Riddle, so that the pair of them looked rather 
like a hospital patient and visitor. 

“I am Professor Dumbledore.” 



Page | 301 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“ ‘Professor?” repeated Riddle. He looked wary. “Is 
that like ‘doctor? What are you here for? Did she get 
you in to have a look at me?” 

He was pointing at the door through which Mrs. Cole 
had just left. 

“No, no,” said Dumbledore, smiling. 

“I don’t believe you,” said Riddle. “She wants me 
looked at, doesn’t she? Tell the truth!” 

He spoke the last three words with a ringing force 
that was almost shocking. It was a command, and it 
sounded as though he had given it many times 
before. His eyes had widened and he was glaring at 
Dumbledore, who made no response except to 
continue smiling pleasantly. After a few seconds 
Riddle stopped glaring, though he looked, if anything, 
warier still. 

“Who are you?” 

“I have told you. My name is Professor Dumbledore 
and I work at a school called Hogwarts. I have come 
to offer you a place at my school — your new school, 
if you would like to come.” 

Riddle’s reaction to this was most surprising. He leapt 
from the bed and backed away from Dumbledore, 
looking furious. 

“You can’t kid me! The asylum, that’s where you’re 
from, isn’t it? ‘Professor,’ yes, of course — well, I’m 
not going, see? That old cat’s the one who should be 
in the asylum. I never did anything to little Amy 
Benson or Dennis Bishop, and you can ask them, 
they’ll tell you!” 



Page | 302 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“I am not from the asylum,” said Dumbledore 
patiently. “I am a teacher and, if you will sit down 
calmly, I shall tell you about Hogwarts. Of course, if 
you would rather not come to the school, nobody will 
force you — ” 

“I’d like to see them try,” sneered Riddle. 

“Hogwarts,” Dumbledore went on, as though he had 
not heard Riddle’s last words, “is a school for people 
with special abilities — ” 

“I’m not mad!” 

“I know that you are not mad. Hogwarts is not a 
school for mad people. It is a school of magic.” 

There was silence. Riddle had frozen, his face 
expressionless, but his eyes were flickering back and 
forth between each of Dumbledore’s, as though trying 
to catch one of them lying. 

“Magic?” he repeated in a whisper. 

“That’s right,” said Dumbledore. 

“It’s ... it’s magic, what I can do?” 

“What is it that you can do?” 

“All sorts,” breathed Riddle. A flush of excitement was 
rising up his neck into his hollow cheeks; he looked 
fevered. “I can make things move without touching 
them. I can make animals do what I want them to do, 
without training them. I can make bad things happen 
to people who annoy me. I can make them hurt if I 
want to.” 



Page | 303 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




His legs were trembling. He stumbled forward and sat 
down on the bed again, staring at his hands, his head 
bowed as though in prayer. 

“I knew I was different,” he whispered to his own 
quivering fingers. “I knew I was special. Always, I 
knew there was something.” 

“Well, you were quite right,” said Dumbledore, who 
was no longer smiling, but watching Riddle intently. 
“You are a wizard.” 

Riddle lifted his head. His face was transfigured: 

There was a wild happiness upon it, yet for some 
reason it did not make him better looking; on the 
contrary, his finely carved features seemed somehow 
rougher, his expression almost bestial. 

“Are you a wizard too?” 

“Yes, I am.” 

“Prove it,” said Riddle at once, in the same 
commanding tone he had used when he had said, 

“Tell the truth.” 

Dumbledore raised his eyebrows. “If, as I take it, you 
are accepting your place at Hogwarts — ” 

“Of course I am!” 

“Then you will address me as ‘Professor’ or ‘sir.’ ” 

Riddle’s expression hardened for the most fleeting 
moment before he said, in an unrecognizably polite 
voice, “I’m sorry, sir. I meant — please, Professor, 
could you show me — ?” 



Page | 304 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Harry was sure that Dumbledore was going to refuse, 
that he would tell Riddle there would be plenty of time 
for practical demonstrations at Hogwarts, that they 
were currently in a building full of Muggles and must 
therefore be cautious. To his great surprise, however, 
Dumbledore drew his wand from an inside pocket of 
his suit jacket, pointed it at the shabby wardrobe in 
the corner, and gave the wand a casual flick. 

The wardrobe burst into flames. 

Riddle jumped to his feet; Harry could hardly blame 
him for howling in shock and rage; all his worldly 
possessions must be in there. But even as Riddle 
rounded on Dumbledore, the flames vanished, leaving 
the wardrobe completely undamaged. 

Riddle stared from the wardrobe to Dumbledore; then, 
his expression greedy, he pointed at the wand. 

“Where can I get one of them?” 

“All in good time,” said Dumbledore. “I think there is 
something trying to get out of your wardrobe.” 

And sure enough, a faint rattling could be heard from 
inside it. For the first time, Riddle looked frightened. 

“Open the door,” said Dumbledore. 

Riddle hesitated, then crossed the room and threw 
open the wardrobe door. On the topmost shelf, above 
a rail of threadbare clothes, a small cardboard box 
was shaking and rattling as though there were several 
frantic mice trapped inside it. 

“Take it out,” said Dumbledore. 

Riddle took down the quaking box. He looked 
unnerved. 

Page | 305 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Is there anything in that box that you ought not to 
have?” asked Dumbledore. 

Riddle threw Dumbledore a long, clear, calculating 
look. “Yes, I suppose so, sir,” he said finally, in an 
expressionless voice. 

“Open it,” said Dumbledore. 

Riddle took off the lid and tipped the contents onto 
his bed without looking at them. Harry, who had 
expected something much more exciting, saw a mess 
of small, everyday objects: a yo-yo, a silver thimble, 
and a tarnished mouth organ among them. Once free 
of the box, they stopped quivering and lay quite still 
upon the thin blankets. 

“You will return them to their owners with your 
apologies,” said Dumbledore calmly, putting his wand 
back into his jacket. “I shall know whether it has 
been done. And be warned: Thieving is not tolerated 
at Hogwarts.” 

Riddle did not look remotely abashed; he was still 
staring coldly and appraisingly at Dumbledore. At last 
he said in a colorless voice, “Yes, sir.” 

“At Hogwarts,” Dumbledore went on, “we teach you 
not only to use magic, but to control it. You have — 
inadvertently, I am sure — been using your powers in 
a way that is neither taught nor tolerated at our 
school. You are not the first, nor will you be the last, 
to allow your magic to run away with you. But you 
should know that Hogwarts can expel students, and 
the Ministry of Magic — yes, there is a Ministry — will 
punish lawbreakers still more severely. All new 
wizards must accept that, in entering our world, they 
abide by our laws.” 



Page | 306 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Yes, sir,” said Riddle again. 



It was impossible to tell what he was thinking; his 
face remained quite blank as he put the little cache of 
stolen objects back into the cardboard box. When he 
had finished, he turned to Dumbledore and said 
baldly, “I haven’t got any money.” 

“That is easily remedied,” said Dumbledore, drawing a 
leather money-pouch from his pocket. “There is a 
fund at Hogwarts for those who require assistance to 
buy books and robes. You might have to buy some of 
your spellbooks and so on secondhand, but — ” 

“Where do you buy spellbooks?” interrupted Riddle, 
who had taken the heavy money bag without 
thanking Dumbledore, and was now examining a fat 
gold Galleon. 

“In Diagon Alley,” said Dumbledore. “I have your list 
of books and school equipment with me. I can help 
you find everything — ” 

“You’re coming with me?” asked Riddle, looking up. 
“Certainly, if you — ” 

“I don’t need you,” said Riddle. “I’m used to doing 
things for myself, I go round London on my own all 
the time. How do you get to this Diagon Alley — sir?” 
he added, catching Dumbledore ’s eye. 

Harry thought that Dumbledore would insist upon 
accompanying Riddle, but once again he was 
surprised. Dumbledore handed Riddle the envelope 
containing his list of equipment, and after telling 
Riddle exactly how to get to the Leaky Cauldron from 
the orphanage, he said, “You will be able to see it, 
although Muggles around you — non-magical people, 
Page | 307 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




that is — will not. Ask for Tom the barman — easy 
enough to remember, as he shares your name — ” 

Riddle gave an irritable twitch, as though trying to 
displace an irksome fly. 

“You dislike the name Tom’?” 

“There are a lot of Toms,” muttered Riddle. Then, as 
though he could not suppress the question, as 
though it burst from him in spite of himself, he 
asked, “Was my father a wizard? He was called Tom 
Riddle too, they’ve told me.” 

“I’m afraid I don’t know,” said Dumbledore, his voice 
gentle. 

“My mother can’t have been magic, or she wouldn’t 
have died,” said Riddle, more to himself than 
Dumbledore. “It must’ve been him. So — when I’ve got 
all my stuff — when do I come to this Hogwarts?” 

“All the details are on the second piece of parchment 
in your envelope,” said Dumbledore. “You will leave 
from King’s Cross Station on the first of September. 
There is a train ticket in there too.” 

Riddle nodded. Dumbledore got to his feet and held 
out his hand again. Taking it, Riddle said, “I can 
speak to snakes. I found out when we’ve been to the 
country on trips — they find me, they whisper to me. 
Is that normal for a wizard?” 

Harry could tell that he had withheld mention of this 
strangest power until that moment, determined to 
impress. 

“It is unusual,” said Dumbledore, after a moment’s 
hesitation, “but not unheard of.” 

Page | 308 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




His tone was casual but his eyes moved curiously 
over Riddle’s face. They stood for a moment, man and 
boy, staring at each other. Then the handshake was 
broken; Dumbledore was at the door. 

“Good-bye, Tom. I shall see you at Hogwarts.” 

“I think that will do,” said the white-haired 
Dumbledore at Harry’s side, and seconds later, they 
were soaring weightlessly through darkness once 
more, before landing squarely in the present-day 
office. 

“Sit down,” said Dumbledore, landing beside Harry. 

Harry obeyed, his mind still full of what he had just 
seen. 

“He believed it much quicker than I did — I mean, 
when you told him he was a wizard,” said Harry. “I 
didn’t believe Hagrid at first, when he told me.” 

“Yes, Riddle was perfectly ready to believe that he was 
— to use his word — ‘special,’ ” said Dumbledore. 

“Did you know — then?” asked Harry. 

“Did I know that I had just met the most dangerous 
Dark wizard of all time?” said Dumbledore. “No, I had 
no idea that he was to grow up to be what he is. 
However, I was certainly intrigued by him. I returned 
to Hogwarts intending to keep an eye upon him, 
something I should have done in any case, given that 
he was alone and friendless, but which, already, I felt 
I ought to do for others’ sake as much as his. 

“His powers, as you heard, were surprisingly well- 
developed for such a young wizard and — most 
interestingly and ominously of all — he had already 

Page | 309 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




discovered that he had some measure of control over 
them, and begun to use them consciously. And as 
you saw, they were not the random experiments 
typical of young wizards: He was already using magic 
against other people, to frighten, to punish, to 
control. The little stories of the strangled rabbit and 
the young boy and girl he lured into a cave were most 
suggestive. ... ‘I can make them hurt if I want to. ...”’ 

“And he was a Parselmouth,” interjected Harry. 

“Yes, indeed; a rare ability, and one supposedly 
connected with the Dark Arts, although as we know, 
there are Parselmouths among the great and the good 
too. In fact, his ability to speak to serpents did not 
make me nearly as uneasy as his obvious instincts for 
cruelty, secrecy, and domination. 

“Time is making fools of us again,” said Dumbledore, 
indicating the dark sky beyond the windows. “But 
before we part, I want to draw your attention to 
certain features of the scene we have just witnessed, 
for they have a great bearing on the matters we shall 
be discussing in future meetings. 

“Firstly, I hope you noticed Riddle’s reaction when I 
mentioned that another shared his first name, Tom’?” 

Harry nodded. 

“There he showed his contempt for anything that tied 
him to other people, anything that made him 
ordinary. Even then, he wished to be different, 
separate, notorious. He shed his name, as you know, 
within a few short years of that conversation and 
created the mask of ‘Lord Voldemort’ behind which he 
has been hidden for so long. 



Page | 310 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“I trust that you also noticed that Tom Riddle was 
already highly self-sufficient, secretive, and, 
apparently, friendless? He did not want help or 
companionship on his trip to Diagon Alley. He 
preferred to operate alone. The adult Voldemort is the 
same. You will hear many of his Death Eaters 
claiming that they are in his confidence, that they 
alone are close to him, even understand him. They 
are deluded. Lord Voldemort has never had a friend, 
nor do I believe that he has ever wanted one. 

“And lastly — I hope you are not too sleepy to pay 
attention to this, Harry — the young Tom Riddle liked 
to collect trophies. You saw the box of stolen articles 
he had hidden in his room. These were taken from 
victims of his bullying behavior, souvenirs, if you will, 
of particularly unpleasant bits of magic. Bear in mind 
this magpie-like tendency, for this, particularly, will 
be important later. 

“And now, it really is time for bed.” 

Harry got to his feet. As he walked across the room, 
his eyes fell upon the little table on which Marvolo 
Gaunt’s ring had rested last time, but the ring was no 
longer there. 

“Yes, Harry?” said Dumbledore, for Harry had come to 
a halt. 

“The ring’s gone,” said Harry, looking around. “But I 
thought you might have the mouth organ or 
something.” 

Dumbledore beamed at him, peering over the top of 
his half-moon spectacles. 

“Very astute, Harry, but the mouth organ was only 
ever a mouth organ.” 

Page | 311 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




And on that enigmatic note he waved to Harry, who 
understood himself to be dismissed. 



Page | 312 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 








FELIX FELICIS 

Harry had Herbology first thing the following 
morning. He had been unable to tell Ron and 
Hermione about his lesson with Dumbledore over 
breakfast for fear of being overheard, but he filled 
them in as they walked across the vegetable patch 
toward the greenhouses. The weekend’s brutal wind 
had died out at last; the weird mist had returned and 
it took them a little longer than usual to find the 
correct greenhouse. 

“Wow, scary thought, the boy You-Know-Who,” said 
Ron quietly, as they took their places around one of 
the gnarled Snargaluff stumps that formed this term’s 
project, and began pulling on their protective gloves. 
“But I still don’t get why Dumbledore’s showing you 
all this. I mean, it’s really interesting and everything, 
but what’s the point?” 

“Dunno,” said Harry, inserting a gum shield. “But he 
says it’s all important and it’ll help me survive.” 



Page | 313 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 



“I think it’s fascinating,” said Hermione earnestly. “It 
makes absolute sense to know as much about 
Voldemort as possible. How else will you find out his 
weaknesses?” 

“So how was Slughorn’s latest party?” Harry asked 
her thickly through the gum shield. 

“Oh, it was quite fun, really,” said Hermione, now 
putting on protective goggles. “I mean, he drones on 
about famous ex-pupils a bit, and he absolutely 
fawns on McLaggen because he’s so well-connected, 
but he gave us some really nice food and he 
introduced us to Gwenog Jones.” 

“Gwenog Jones?” said Ron, his eyes widening under 
his own goggles. “The Gwenog Jones? Captain of the 
Holyhead Harpies?” 

“That’s right,” said Hermione. “Personally, I thought 
she was a bit full of herself, but — ” 

“Quite enough chat over here!” said Professor Sprout 
briskly, bustling over and looking stern. “You’re 
lagging behind, everybody else has started, and 
Neville’s already got his first pod!” 

They looked around; sure enough, there sat Neville 
with a bloody lip and several nasty scratches along 
the side of his face, but clutching an unpleasantly 
pulsating green object about the size of a grapefruit. 

“Okay, Professor, we’re starting now!” said Ron, 
adding quietly, when she had turned away again, 
“should’ve used Muffliato, Harry.” 

“No, we shouldn’t!” said Hermione at once, looking, as 
she always did, intensely cross at the thought of the 



Page | 314 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Half-Blood Prince and his spells. “Well, come on ... 
we’d better get going. ...” 



She gave the other two an apprehensive look; they all 
took deep breaths and then dived at the gnarled 
stump between them. 

It sprang to life at once; long, prickly, bramblelike 
vines flew out of the top and whipped through the air. 
One tangled itself in Hermione’s hair, and Ron beat it 
back with a pair of secateurs; Harry succeeded in 
trapping a couple of vines and knotting them 
together; a hole opened in the middle of all the 
tentaclelike branches; Hermione plunged her arm 
bravely into this hole, which closed like a trap around 
her elbow; Harry and Ron tugged and wrenched at 
the vines, forcing the hole to open again, and 
Hermione snatched her arm free, clutching in her 
fingers a pod just like Neville’s. At once, the prickly 
vines shot back inside, and the gnarled stump sat 
there looking like an innocently dead lump of wood. 

“You know, I don’t think I’ll be having any of these in 
my garden when I’ve got my own place,” said Ron, 
pushing his goggles up onto his forehead and wiping 
sweat from his face. 

“Pass me a bowl,” said Hermione, holding the 
pulsating pod at arm’s length; Harry handed one over 
and she dropped the pod into it with a look of disgust 
on her face. 

“Don’t be squeamish, squeeze it out, they’re best 
when they’re fresh!” called Professor Sprout. 

“Anyway,” said Hermione, continuing their 
interrupted conversation as though a lump of wood 
had not just attacked them, “Slughorn’s going to have 
a Christmas party, Harry, and there’s no way you’ll be 

Page | 315 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




able to wriggle out of this one because he actually 
asked me to check your free evenings, so he could be 
sure to have it on a night you can come.” 

Harry groaned. Meanwhile, Ron, who was attempting 
to burst the pod in the bowl by putting both hands on 
it, standing up, and squashing it as hard as he could, 
said angrily, “And this is another party just for 
Slughorn’s favorites, is it?” 

“Just for the Slug Club, yes,” said Hermione. 

The pod flew out from under Ron’s fingers and hit the 
greenhouse glass, rebounding onto the back of 
Professor Sprout’s head and knocking off her old, 
patched hat. Harry went to retrieve the pod; when he 
got back, Hermione was saying, “Look, / didn’t make 
up the name ‘Slug Club’ — ” 

“ ‘Slug Club,’ ” repeated Ron with a sneer worthy of 
Malfoy. “It’s pathetic. Well, I hope you enjoy your 
party. Why don’t you try hooking up with McLaggen, 
then Slughorn can make you King and Queen Slug — 



“We’re allowed to bring guests,” said Hermione, who 
for some reason had turned a bright, boiling scarlet, 
“and I was going to ask you to come, but if you think 
it’s that stupid then I won’t bother!” 

Harry suddenly wished the pod had flown a little 
farther, so that he need not have been sitting here 
with the pair of them. Unnoticed by either, he seized 
the bowl that contained the pod and began to try and 
open it by the noisiest and most energetic means he 
could think of; unfortunately, he could still hear every 
word of their conversation. 



Page | 316 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“You were going to ask me?” asked Ron, in a 
completely different voice. 

“Yes,” said Hermione angrily. “But obviously if you’d 
rather I hooked up with McLaggen ...” 

There was a pause while Harry continued to pound 
the resilient pod with a trowel. 

“No, I wouldn’t,” said Ron, in a very quiet voice. 

Harry missed the pod, hit the bowl, and shattered it. 

“Reparo,” he said hastily, poking the pieces with his 
wand, and the bowl sprang back together again. The 
crash, however, appeared to have awoken Ron and 
Hermione to Harry’s presence. Hermione looked 
flustered and immediately started fussing about for 
her copy of Flesh-Eating Trees of the World to find out 
the correct way to juice Snargaluff pods; Ron, on the 
other hand, looked sheepish but also rather pleased 
with himself. 

“Hand that over, Harry,” said Hermione hurriedly. “It 
says we’re supposed to puncture them with 
something sharp. ...” 

Harry passed her the pod in the bowl; he and Ron 
both snapped their goggles back over their eyes and 
dived, once more, for the stump. 

It was not as though he was really surprised, thought 
Harry, as he wrestled with a thorny vine intent upon 
throttling him; he had had an inkling that this might 
happen sooner or later. But he was not sure how he 
felt about it. ... He and Cho were now too 
embarrassed to look at each other, let alone talk to 
each other; what if Ron and Hermione started going 
out together, then split up? Could their friendship 
Page | 317 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




survive it? Harry remembered the few weeks when 
they had not been talking to each other in the third 
year; he had not enjoyed trying to bridge the distance 
between them. And then, what if they didn’t split up? 
What if they became like Bill and Fleur, and it 
became excruciatingly embarrassing to be in their 
presence, so that he was shut out for good? 

“Gotcha!” yelled Ron, pulling a second pod from the 
stump just as Hermione managed to burst the first 
one open, so that the bowl was full of tubers wriggling 
like pale green worms. 

The rest of the lesson passed without further mention 
of Slughorn’s party. Although Harry watched his two 
friends more closely over the next few days, Ron and 
Hermione did not seem any different except that they 
were a little politer to each other than usual. Harry 
supposed he would just have to wait to see what 
happened under the influence of butterbeer in 
Slughorn’s dimly lit room on the night of the party. In 
the meantime, however, he had more pressing 
worries. 

Katie Bell was still in St. Mungo’s Hospital with no 
prospect of leaving, which meant that the promising 
Gryffindor team Harry had been training so carefully 
since September was one Chaser short. He kept 
putting off replacing Katie in the hope that she would 
return, but their opening match against Slytherin was 
looming, and he finally had to accept that she would 
not be back in time to play. 

Harry did not think he could stand another full- 
House tryout. With a sinking feeling that had little to 
do with Quidditch, he cornered Dean Thomas after 
Transfiguration one day. Most of the class had 
already left, although several twittering yellow birds 
were still zooming around the room, all of Hermione ’s 
Page | 318 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




creation; nobody else had succeeded in conjuring so 
much as a feather from thin air. 

“Are you still interested in playing Chaser?” 

“Wha — ? Yeah, of course!” said Dean excitedly. Over 
Dean’s shoulder, Harry saw Seamus Finnigan 
slamming his books into his bag, looking sour. One of 
the reasons why Harry would have preferred not to 
have to ask Dean to play was that he knew Seamus 
would not like it. On the other hand, he had to do 
what was best for the team, and Dean had outflown 
Seamus at the tryouts. 

“Well then, you’re in,” said Harry. “There’s a practice 
tonight, seven o’clock.” 

“Right,” said Dean. “Cheers, Harry! Blimey, I can’t 
wait to tell Ginny!” 

He sprinted out of the room, leaving Harry and 
Seamus alone together, an uncomfortable moment 
made no easier when a bird dropping landed on 
Seamus’s head as one of Hermione’s canaries whizzed 
over them. 

Seamus was not the only person disgruntled by the 
choice of Katie’s substitute. There was much 
muttering in the common room about the fact that 
Harry had now chosen two of his classmates for the 
team. As Harry had endured much worse mutterings 
than this in his school career, he was not particularly 
bothered, but all the same, the pressure was 
increasing to provide a win in the upcoming match 
against Slytherin. If Gryffindor won, Harry knew that 
the whole House would forget that they had criticized 
him and swear that they had always known it was a 
great team. If they lost ... well, Harry thought wryly, 
he had still endured worse mutterings. ... 

Page | 319 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Harry had no reason to regret his choice once he saw 
Dean fly that evening; he worked well with Ginny and 
Demelza. The Beaters, Peakes and Coote, were getting 
better all the time. The only problem was Ron. 

Harry had known all along that Ron was an 
inconsistent player who suffered from nerves and a 
lack of confidence, and unfortunately, the looming 
prospect of the opening game of the season seemed to 
have brought out all his old insecurities. After letting 
in half a dozen goals, most of them scored by Ginny, 
his technique became wilder and wilder, until he 
finally punched an oncoming Demelza Robins in the 
mouth. 

“It was an accident, I’m sorry, Demelza, really sorry!” 
Ron shouted after her as she zigzagged back to the 
ground, dripping blood everywhere. “I just — ” 

“Panicked,” Ginny said angrily, landing next to 
Demelza and examining her fat lip. “You prat, Ron, 
look at the state of her!” 

“I can fix that,” said Harry, landing beside the two 
girls, pointing his wand at Demelza’s mouth, and 
saying “Episkey.” “And Ginny, don’t call Ron a prat, 
you’re not the Captain of this team — ” 

“Well, you seemed too busy to call him a prat and I 
thought someone should — ” 

Harry forced himself not to laugh. 

“In the air, everyone, let’s go. ...” 

Overall it was one of the worst practices they had had 
all term, though Harry did not feel that honesty was 
the best policy when they were this close to the 
match. 

Page | 320 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Good work, everyone, I think we’ll flatten Slytherin,” 
he said bracingly and the Chasers and Beaters left 
the changing room looking reasonably happy with 
themselves. 

“I played like a sack of dragon dung,” said Ron in a 
hollow voice when the door had swung shut behind 
Ginny. 

“No, you didn’t,” said Harry firmly. “You’re the best 
Keeper I tried out, Ron. Your only problem is nerves.” 

He kept up a relentless flow of encouragement all the 
way back to the castle, and by the time they reached 
the second floor, Ron was looking marginally more 
cheerful. When Harry pushed open the tapestry to 
take their usual shortcut up to Gryffindor Tower, 
however, they found themselves looking at Dean and 
Ginny, who were locked in a close embrace and 
kissing fiercely as though glued together. 

It was as though something large and scaly erupted 
into life in Harry’s stomach, clawing at his insides: 

Hot blood seemed to flood his brain, so that all 
thought was extinguished, replaced by a savage urge 
to jinx Dean into a jelly. Wrestling with this sudden 
madness, he heard Ron’s voice as though from a great 
distance away. 

“Oi!” 



Dean and Ginny broke apart and looked around. 
“What?” said Ginny. 

“I don’t want to find my own sister snogging people in 
public!” 



Page | 321 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“This was a deserted corridor till you came butting 
in!” said Ginny. 

Dean was looking embarrassed. He gave Harry a 
shifty grin that Harry did not return, as the newborn 
monster inside him was roaring for Dean’s instant 
dismissal from the team. 

“Er ... c’mon, Ginny,” said Dean, “let’s go back to the 
common room. ...” 

“You go!” said Ginny. “I want a word with my dear 
brother!” 

Dean left, looking as though he was not sorry to 
depart the scene. 

“Right,” said Ginny, tossing her long red hair out of 
her face and glaring at Ron, “let’s get this straight 
once and for all. It is none of your business who I go 
out with or what I do with them, Ron — ” 

“Yeah, it is!” said Ron, just as angrily. “D’you think I 
want people saying my sister’s a — ” 

“A what?” shouted Ginny, drawing her wand. “A what, 
exactly?” 

“He doesn’t mean anything, Ginny — ” said Harry 
automatically, though the monster was roaring its 
approval of Ron’s words. 

“Oh yes he does!” she said, flaring up at Harry. “Just 
because he’s never snogged anyone in his life, just 
because the best kiss he’s ever had is from our Auntie 
Muriel — ” 

“Shut your mouth!” bellowed Ron, bypassing red and 
turning maroon. 

Page | 322 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“No, I will not!” yelled Ginny, beside herself. “I’ve seen 
you with Phlegm, hoping shell kiss you on the cheek 
every time you see her, it’s pathetic! If you went out 
and got a bit of snogging done yourself, you wouldn’t 
mind so much that everyone else does it!” 

Ron had pulled out his wand too; Harry stepped 
swiftly between them. 

“You don’t know what you’re talking about!” Ron 
roared, trying to get a clear shot at Ginny around 
Harry, who was now standing in front of her with his 
arms outstretched. “Just because I don’t do it in 
public — !” 

Ginny screamed with derisive laughter, trying to push 
Harry out of the way. 

“Been kissing Pigwidgeon, have you? Or have you got 
a picture of Auntie Muriel stashed under your 
pillow?” 

“You—” 

A streak of orange light flew under Harry’s left arm 
and missed Ginny by inches; Harry pushed Ron up 
against the wall. 

“Don’t be stupid — ” 

“Harry’s snogged Cho Chang!” shouted Ginny, who 
sounded close to tears now. “And Hermione snogged 
Viktor Krum, it’s only you who acts like it’s something 
disgusting, Ron, and that’s because you’ve got about 
as much experience as a twelve-year-old!” 

And with that, she stormed away. Harry quickly let go 
of Ron; the look on his face was murderous. They 
both stood there, breathing heavily, until Mrs. Norris, 

Page | 323 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Filch ’s cat, appeared around the corner, which broke 
the tension. 



“C’mon,” said Harry, as the sound of Filch ’s shuffling 
feet reached their ears. 

They hurried up the stairs and along a seventh-floor 
corridor. “Oi, out of the way!” Ron barked at a small 
girl who jumped in fright and dropped a bottle of 
toadspawn. 

Harry hardly noticed the sound of shattering glass; he 
felt disoriented, dizzy; being struck by a lightning bolt 
must be something like this. It’s just because she’s 
Ron’s sister, he told himself. You just didn’t like seeing 
her kissing Dean because she’s Ron’s sister. ... 

But unbidden into his mind came an image of that 
same deserted corridor with himself kissing Ginny 
instead. ... The monster in his chest purred ... but 
then he saw Ron ripping open the tapestry curtain 
and drawing his wand on Harry, shouting things like 
“betrayal of trust” . . . “supposed to be my friend” . . . 

“D’you think Hermione did snog Krum?” Ron asked 
abruptly, as they approached the Fat Lady. Harry 
gave a guilty start and wrenched his imagination 
away from a corridor in which no Ron intruded, in 
which he and Ginny were quite alone — 

“What?” he said confusedly. “Oh ... er ...” 

The honest answer was “yes,” but he did not want to 
give it. However, Ron seemed to gather the worst from 
the look on Harry’s face. 

“Dilligrout,” he said darkly to the Fat Lady, and they 
climbed through the portrait hole into the common 
room. 

Page | 324 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Neither of them mentioned Ginny or Hermione again; 
indeed, they barely spoke to each other that evening 
and got into bed in silence, each absorbed in his own 
thoughts. 

Harry lay awake for a long time, looking up at the 
canopy of his four-poster and trying to convince 
himself that his feelings for Ginny were entirely elder- 
brotherly. They had lived, had they not, like brother 
and sister all summer, playing Quidditch, teasing 
Ron, and having a laugh about Bill and Phlegm? He 
had known Ginny for years now. ... It was natural 
that he should feel protective . . . natural that he 
should want to look out for her . . . want to rip Dean 
limb from limb for kissing her ... No ... he would have 
to control that particular brotherly feeling. . . . 

Ron gave a great grunting snore. 

She’s Ron’s sister, Harry told himself firmly. Ron’s 
sister. She’s out-of-bounds. He would not risk his 
friendship with Ron for anything. He punched his 
pillow into a more comfortable shape and waited for 
sleep to come, trying his utmost not to allow his 
thoughts to stray anywhere near Ginny. 

Harry awoke next morning feeling slightly dazed and 
confused by a series of dreams in which Ron had 
chased him with a Beater’s bat, but by midday he 
would have happily exchanged the dream Ron for the 
real one, who was not only cold-shouldering Ginny 
and Dean, but also treating a hurt and bewildered 
Hermione with an icy, sneering indifference. What 
was more, Ron seemed to have become, overnight, as 
touchy and ready to lash out as the average Blast- 
Ended Skrewt. Harry spent the day attempting to 
keep the peace between Ron and Hermione with no 
success; finally, Hermione departed for bed in high 
dudgeon, and Ron stalked off to the boys’ dormitory 
Page | 325 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




after swearing angrily at several frightened first years 
for looking at him. 

To Harry’s dismay, Ron’s new aggression did not wear 
off over the next few days. Worse still, it coincided 
with an even deeper dip in his Keeping skills, which 
made him still more aggressive, so that during the 
final Quidditch practice before Saturday’s match, he 
failed to save every single goal the Chasers aimed at 
him, but bellowed at everybody so much that he 
reduced Demelza Robins to tears. 

“You shut up and leave her alone!” shouted Peakes, 
who was about two-thirds Ron’s height, though 
admittedly carrying a heavy bat. 

“ENOUGH!” bellowed Harry, who had seen Ginny 
glowering in Ron’s direction and, remembering her 
reputation as an accomplished caster of the Bat- 
Bogey Hex, soared over to intervene before things got 
out of hand. “Peakes, go and pack up the Bludgers. 
Demelza, pull yourself together, you played really well 
today. Ron ...” he waited until the rest of the team 
were out of earshot before saying it, “you’re my best 
mate, but carry on treating the rest of them like this 
and I’m going to kick you off the team.” 

He really thought for a moment that Ron might hit 
him, but then something much worse happened: Ron 
seemed to sag on his broom; all the fight went out of 
him and he said, “I resign. I’m pathetic.” 

“You’re not pathetic and you’re not resigning!” said 
Harry fiercely, seizing Ron by the front of his robes. 
“You can save anything when you’re on form, it’s a 
mental problem you’ve got!” 

“You calling me mental?” 



Page | 326 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Yeah, maybe I am!” 

They glared at each other for a moment, then Ron 
shook his head wearily. “I know you haven’t got any 
time to find another Keeper, so I’ll play tomorrow, but 
if we lose, and we will, I’m taking myself off the team.” 

Nothing Harry said made any difference. He tried 
boosting Ron’s confidence all through dinner, but Ron 
was too busy being grumpy and surly with Hermione 
to notice. Harry persisted in the common room that 
evening, but his assertion that the whole team would 
be devastated if Ron left was somewhat undermined 
by the fact that the rest of the team was sitting in a 
huddle in a distant corner, clearly muttering about 
Ron and casting him nasty looks. Finally Harry tried 
getting angry again in the hope of provoking Ron into 
a defiant, and hopefully goal-saving, attitude, but this 
strategy did not appear to work any better than 
encouragement; Ron went to bed as dejected and 
hopeless as ever. 

Harry lay awake for a very long time in the darkness. 
He did not want to lose the upcoming match; not only 
was it his first as Captain, but he was determined to 
beat Draco Malfoy at Quidditch even if he could not 
yet prove his suspicions about him. Yet if Ron played 
as he had done in the last few practices, their 
chances of winning were very slim. ... 

If only there was something he could do to make Ron 
pull himself together . . . make him play at the top of 
his form . . . something that would ensure that Ron 
had a really good day. ... 

And the answer came to Harry in one, sudden, 
glorious stroke of inspiration. 



Page | 327 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Breakfast was the usual excitable affair next morning; 
the Slytherins hissed and booed loudly as every 
member of the Gryffindor team entered the Great 
Hall. Harry glanced at the ceiling and saw a clear, 
pale blue sky: a good omen. 

The Gryffindor table, a solid mass of red and gold, 
cheered as Harry and Ron approached. Harry grinned 
and waved; Ron grimaced weakly and shook his head. 

“Cheer up, Ron!” called Lavender. “I know you’ll be 
brilliant!” 

Ron ignored her. 

“Tea?” Harry asked him. “Coffee? Pumpkin juice?” 

“Anything,” said Ron glumly, taking a moody bite of 
toast. 

A few minutes later Hermione, who had become so 
tired of Ron’s recent unpleasant behavior that she 
had not come down to breakfast with them, paused 
on her way up the table. 

“How are you both feeling?” she asked tentatively, her 
eyes on the back of Ron’s head. 

“Fine,” said Harry, who was concentrating on handing 
Ron a glass of pumpkin juice. “There you go, Ron. 
Drink up.” 

Ron had just raised the glass to his lips when 
Hermione spoke sharply. 

“Don’t drink that, Ron!” 

Both Harry and Ron looked up at her. 



Page | 328 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Why not?” said Ron. 



Hermione was now staring at Harry as though she 
could not believe her eyes. 

“You just put something in that drink.” 

“Excuse me?” said Harry. 

“You heard me. I saw you. You just tipped something 
into Ron’s drink. You’ve got the bottle in your hand 
right now!” 

“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” said Harry, 
stowing the little bottle hastily in his pocket. 

“Ron, I warn you, don’t drink it!” Hermione said 
again, alarmed, but Ron picked up the glass, drained 
it in one gulp, and said, “Stop bossing me around, 
Hermione.” 

She looked scandalized. Bending low so that only 
Harry could hear her, she hissed, “You should be 
expelled for that. I’d never have believed it of you, 
Harry!” 

“Hark who’s talking,” he whispered back. “Confunded 
anyone lately?” 

She stormed up the table away from them. Harry 
watched her go without regret. Hermione had never 
really understood what a serious business Quidditch 
was. He then looked around at Ron, who was 
smacking his lips. 

“Nearly time,” said Harry blithely. 

The frosty grass crunched underfoot as they strode 
down to the stadium. 

Page | 329 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Pretty lucky the weather’s this good, eh?” Harry 
asked Ron. 



“Yeah,” said Ron, who was pale and sick-looking. 

Ginny and Demelza were already wearing their 
Quidditch robes and waiting in the changing room. 

“Conditions look ideal,” said Ginny, ignoring Ron. 

“And guess what? That Slytherin Chaser Vaisey — he 
took a Bludger in the head yesterday during their 
practice, and he’s too sore to play! And even better 
than that — Malfoy’s gone off sick too!” 

“ What?” said Harry, wheeling around to stare at her. 
“He’s ill? What’s wrong with him?” 

“No idea, but it’s great for us,” said Ginny brightly. 
“They’re playing Harper instead; he’s in my year and 
he’s an idiot.” 

Harry smiled back vaguely, but as he pulled on his 
scarlet robes his mind was far from Quidditch. Malfoy 
had once before claimed he could not play due to 
injury, but on that occasion he had made sure the 
whole match was rescheduled for a time that suited 
the Slytherins better. Why was he now happy to let a 
substitute go on? Was he really ill, or was he faking? 

“Fishy, isn’t it?” he said in an undertone to Ron. 
“Malfoy not playing?” 

“Lucky, I call it,” said Ron, looking slightly more 
animated. “And Vaisey off too, he’s their best goal 
scorer, I didn’t fancy — hey!” he said suddenly, 
freezing halfway through pulling on his Keeper’s 
gloves and staring at Harry. 

“What?” 

Page | 330 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“I ... you ...” Ron had dropped his voice, he looked 
both scared and excited. “My drink ... my pumpkin 
juice ... you didn’t ... ?” 

Harry raised his eyebrows, but said nothing except, 
“Well be starting in about five minutes, you’d better 
get your boots on.” 

They walked out onto the pitch to tumultuous roars 
and boos. One end of the stadium was solid red and 
gold; the other, a sea of green and silver. Many 
Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws had taken sides too: 
Amidst all the yelling and clapping Harry could 
distinctly hear the roar of Luna Lovegood’s famous 
lion-topped hat. 

Harry stepped up to Madam Hooch, the referee, who 
was standing ready to release the balls from the crate. 

“Captains shake hands,” she said, and Harry had his 
hand crushed by the new Slytherin Captain, 

Urquhart. “Mount your brooms. On the whistle ... 
three ... two ... one ...” 

The whistle sounded, Harry and the others kicked off 
hard from the frozen ground, and they were away. 

Harry soared around the perimeter of the grounds, 
looking around for the Snitch and keeping one eye on 
Harper, who was zigzagging far below him. Then a 
voice that was jarringly different to the usual 
commentator’s started up. 

“Well, there they go, and I think we’re all surprised to 
see the team that Potter’s put together this year. 

Many thought, given Ronald Weasley’s patchy 
performance as Keeper last year, that he might be off 
the team, but of course, a close personal friendship 
with the Captain does help. ...” 

Page | 331 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling 




These words were greeted with jeers and applause 
from the Slytherin end of the pitch. Harry craned 
around on his broom to look toward the 
commentator’s podium. A tall, skinny blond boy with 
an upturned nose was standing there, talking into the 
magical megaphone that had once been Lee Jordan’s; 
Harry recognized Zacharias Smith, a Hufflepuff player 
whom he heartily disliked. 

“Oh, and here comes Slytherin ’s first attempt on goal, 
it’s Urquhart streaking down the pitch and — ” 

Harry’s stomach turned over. 

“ — Weasley saves it, well, he’s bound to get lucky 
sometimes, I suppose. ...” 

“That’s right, Smith, he is,” muttered Harry, grinning 
to himself, as he dived amongst the Chasers with his 
eyes searching all around for some hint of the elusive 
Snitch. 

With half an hour of the game gone, Gryffindor were 
leading sixty points to zero, Ron having made some 
truly spectacular saves, some by the very tips of his 
gloves, and Ginny having scored four of Gryffindor’s 
six goals. This effectively stopped Zacharias 
wondering loudly whether the two Weasleys were only 
there because Harry liked them, and he started on 
Peakes and Coote instead. 

“Of course, Coote isn’t really the usual build for a 
Beater,” said Zacharias loftily, “they’ve generally got a 
bit more muscle — ” 

“Hit a Bludger at him!” Harry called to Coote as he 
zoomed past, but Coote, grinning broadly, chose to 
aim the next Bludger at Harper instead, who was just 
passing Harry in the opposite direction. Harry was 

Page | 332 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




pleased to hear the dull thunk that meant the 
Bludger had found its mark. 

It seemed as though Gryffindor could do no wrong. 
Again and again they scored, and again and again, at 
the other end of the pitch, Ron saved goals with 
apparent ease. He was actually smiling now, and 
when the crowd greeted a particularly good save with 
a rousing chorus of the old favorite “Weasley Is Our 
King,” he pretended to conduct them from on high. 

“Thinks he’s something special today, doesn’t he?” 
said a snide voice, and Harry was nearly knocked off 
his broom as Harper collided with him hard and 
deliberately. “Your blood-traitor pal ...” 

Madam Hooch’s back was turned, and though 
Gryffindors below shouted in anger, by the time she 
looked around, Harper had already sped off. His 
shoulder aching, Harry raced after him, determined to 
ram him back. . . . 

“And I think Harper of Slytherin’s seen the Snitch!” 
said Zacharias Smith through his megaphone. “Yes, 
he’s certainly seen something Potter hasn’t!” 

Smith really was an idiot, thought Harry, hadn’t he 
noticed them collide? But next moment, his stomach 
seemed to drop out of the sky — Smith was right and 
Harry was wrong: Harper had not sped upward at 
random; he had spotted what Harry had not: The 
Snitch was speeding along high above them, glinting 
brightly against the clear blue sky. 

Harry accelerated; the wind was whistling in his ears 
so that it drowned all sound of Smith’s commentary 
or the crowd, but Harper was still ahead of him, and 
Gryffindor was only a hundred points up; if Harper 



Page | 333 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




got there first Gryffindor had lost . . . and now Harper 
was feet from it, his hand outstretched. ... 

“Oi, Harper!” yelled Harry in desperation. “How much 
did Malfoy pay you to come on instead of him?” 

He did not know what made him say it, but Harper 
did a double-take; he fumbled the Snitch, let it slip 
through his fingers, and shot right past it. Harry 
made a great swipe for the tiny, fluttering ball and 
caught it. 

“YES!” Harry yelled. Wheeling around, he hurtled 
back toward the ground, the Snitch held high in his 
hand. As the crowd realized what had happened, a 
great shout went up that almost drowned the sound 
of the whistle that signaled the end of the game. 

“Ginny, where ’re you going?” yelled Harry, who had 
found himself trapped in the midst of a mass midair 
hug with the rest of the team, but Ginny sped right 
on past them until, with an almighty crash, she 
collided with the commentator’s podium. As the 
crowd shrieked and laughed, the Gryffindor team 
landed beside the wreckage of wood under which 
Zacharias was feebly stirring; Harry heard Ginny 
saying blithely to an irate Professor McGonagall, 
“Forgot to brake, Professor, sorry.” 

Laughing, Harry broke free of the rest of the team and 
hugged Ginny, but let go very quickly. Avoiding her 
gaze, he clapped a cheering Ron on the back instead 
as, all enmity forgotten, the Gryffindor team left the 
pitch arm in arm, punching the air and waving to 
their supporters. 

The atmosphere in the changing room was jubilant. 



Page | 334 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Party up in the common room, Seamus said!” yelled 
Dean exuberantly. “C’mon, Ginny, Demelza!” 

Ron and Harry were the last two in the changing 
room. They were just about to leave when Hermione 
entered. She was twisting her Gryffindor scarf in her 
hands and looked upset but determined. 

“I want a word with you, Harry.” She took a deep 
breath. “You shouldn’t have done it. You heard 
Slughorn, it’s illegal.” 

“What are you going to do, turn us in?” demanded 
Ron. 

“What are you two talking about?” asked Harry, 
turning away to hang up his robes so that neither of 
them would see him grinning. 

“You know perfectly well what we’re talking about!” 
said Hermione shrilly. “You spiked Ron’s juice with 
lucky potion at breakfast! Felix Felicis!” 

“No, I didn’t,” said Harry, turning back to face them 
both. 

“Yes you did, Harry, and that’s why everything went 
right, there were Slytherin players missing and Ron 
saved everything!” 

“I didn’t put it in!” said Harry, grinning broadly. He 
slipped his hand inside his jacket pocket and drew 
out the tiny bottle that Hermione had seen in his 
hand that morning. It was full of golden potion and 
the cork was still tightly sealed with wax. “I wanted 
Ron to think I’d done it, so I faked it when I knew you 
were looking.” He looked at Ron. “You saved 
everything because you felt lucky. You did it all 
yourself.” 

Page | 335 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




He pocketed the potion again. 



“There really wasn’t anything in my pumpkin juice?” 
Ron said, astounded. “But the weather’s good ... and 
Vaisey couldn’t play. ... I honestly haven’t been given 
lucky potion?” 

Harry shook his head. Ron gaped at him for a 
moment, then rounded on Hermione, imitating her 
voice. “ You added Felix Felicis to Ron’s juice this 
morning, that’s why he saved every thing\ See! I can 
save goals without help, Hermione!” 

“I never said you couldn’t — Ron, you thought you’d 
been given it too!” 

But Ron had already strode past her out of the door 
with his broomstick over his shoulder. 

“Er,” said Harry into the sudden silence; he had not 
expected his plan to backfire like this, “shall ... shall 
we go up to the party, then?” 

“You go!” said Hermione, blinking back tears. “I’m 
sick of Ron at the moment, I don’t know what I’m 
supposed to have done. ...” 

And she stormed out of the changing room too. 

Harry walked slowly back up the grounds toward the 
castle through the crowd, many of whom shouted 
congratulations at him, but he felt a great sense of 
letdown; he had been sure that if Ron won the match, 
he and Hermione would be friends again immediately. 
He did not see how he could possibly explain to 
Hermione that what she had done to offend Ron was 
kiss Viktor Krum, not when the offense had occurred 
so long ago. 



Page | 336 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Harry could not see Hermione at the Gryffindor 
celebration party, which was in full swing when he 
arrived. Renewed cheers and clapping greeted his 
appearance, and he was soon surrounded by a mob of 
people congratulating him. What with trying to shake 
off the Creevey brothers, who wanted a blow-by-blow 
match analysis, and the large group of girls that 
encircled him, laughing at his least amusing 
comments and batting their eyelids, it was some time 
before he could try and find Ron. At last, he 
extricated himself from Romilda Vane, who was 
hinting heavily that she would like to go to Slughorn’s 
Christmas party with him. As he was ducking toward 
the drinks table, he walked straight into Ginny, 

Arnold the Pygmy Puff riding on her shoulder and 
Crookshanks mewing hopefully at her heels. 

“Looking for Ron?” she asked, smirking. “He’s over 
there, the filthy hypocrite.” 

Harry looked into the corner she was indicating. 

There, in full view of the whole room, stood Ron 
wrapped so closely around Lavender Brown it was 
hard to tell whose hands were whose. 

“It looks like he’s eating her face, doesn’t it?” said 
Ginny dispassionately. “But I suppose he’s got to 
refine his technique somehow. Good game, Harry.” 

She patted him on the arm; Harry felt a swooping 
sensation in his stomach, but then she walked off to 
help herself to more butterbeer. Crookshanks trotted 
after her, his yellow eyes fixed upon Arnold. 

Harry turned away from Ron, who did not look like he 
would be surfacing soon, just as the portrait hole was 
closing. With a sinking feeling, he thought he saw a 
mane of bushy brown hair whipping out of sight. 



Page | 337 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




He darted forward, sidestepped Romilda Vane again, 
and pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady. The 
corridor outside seemed to be deserted. 

“Hermione?” 

He found her in the first unlocked classroom he tried. 
She was sitting on the teacher’s desk, alone except for 
a small ring of twittering yellow birds circling her 
head, which she had clearly just conjured out of 
midair. Harry could not help admiring her spell-work 
at a time like this. 

“Oh, hello, Harry,” she said in a brittle voice. “I was 
just practicing.” 

“Yeah ... they’re — er — really good. ...” said Harry. 

He had no idea what to say to her. He was just 
wondering whether there was any chance that she 
had not noticed Ron, that she had merely left the 
room because the party was a little too rowdy, when 
she said, in an unnaturally high-pitched voice, “Ron 
seems to be enjoying the celebrations.” 

“Er . . . does he?” said Harry. 

“Don’t pretend you didn’t see him,” said Hermione. 

“He wasn’t exactly hiding it, was — ?” 

The door behind them burst open. To Harry’s horror, 
Ron came in, laughing, pulling Lavender by the hand. 

“Oh,” he said, drawing up short at the sight of Harry 
and Hermione. 

“Oops!” said Lavender, and she backed out of the 
room, giggling. The door swung shut behind her. 



Page | 338 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




There was a horrible, swelling, billowing silence. 
Hermione was staring at Ron, who refused to look at 
her, but said with an odd mixture of bravado and 
awkwardness, “Hi, Harry! Wondered where you’d got 
to!” 

Hermione slid off the desk. The little flock of golden 
birds continued to twitter in circles around her head 
so that she looked like a strange, feathery model of 
the solar system. 

“You shouldn’t leave Lavender waiting outside,” she 
said quietly. “She’ll wonder where you’ve gone.” 

She walked very slowly and erectly toward the door. 
Harry glanced at Ron, who was looking relieved that 
nothing worse had happened. 

“ Oppugno\” came a shriek from the doorway. 

Harry spun around to see Hermione pointing her 
wand at Ron, her expression wild: The little flock of 
birds was speeding like a hail of fat golden bullets 
toward Ron, who yelped and covered his face with his 
hands, but the birds attacked, pecking and clawing at 
every bit of flesh they could reach. 

“Gerremoffme!” he yelled, but with one last look of 
vindictive fury, Hermione wrenched open the door 
and disappeared through it. Harry thought he heard a 
sob before it slammed.

THE UNBREAKABLE VOW 

Snow was swirling against the icy windows once 
more; Christmas was approaching fast. Hagrid had 
already single-handedly delivered the usual twelve 
Christmas trees for the Great Hall; garlands of holly 
and tinsel had been twisted around the banisters of 
the stairs; everlasting candles glowed from inside the 
helmets of suits of armor and great bunches of 
mistletoe had been hung at intervals along the 
corridors. Large groups of girls tended to converge 
underneath the mistletoe bunches every time Harry 
went past, which caused blockages in the corridors; 
fortunately, however, Harry’s frequent nighttime 
wanderings had given him an unusually good 
knowledge of the castle’s secret passageways, so that 
he was able, without too much difficulty, to navigate 
mistletoe-free routes between classes. 

Ron, who might once have found the necessity of 
these detours a cause for jealousy rather than 
hilarity, simply roared with laughter about it all. 
Although Harry much preferred this new laughing, 



Page | 340 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 



joking Ron to the moody, aggressive model he had 
been enduring for the last few weeks, the improved 
Ron came at a heavy price. Firstly, Harry had to put 
up with the frequent presence of Lavender Brown, 
who seemed to regard any moment that she was not 
kissing Ron as a moment wasted; and secondly, 

Harry found himself once more the best friend of two 
people who seemed unlikely ever to speak to each 
other again. 

Ron, whose hands and forearms still bore scratches 
and cuts from Hermione’s bird attack, was taking a 
defensive and resentful tone. 

“She can’t complain,” he told Harry. “She snogged 
Krum. So she’s found out someone wants to snog me 
too. Well, it’s a free country. I haven’t done anything 
wrong.” 

Harry did not answer, but pretended to be absorbed 
in the book they were supposed to have read before 
Charms next morning (Quintessence: A Quest). 
Determined as he was to remain friends with both 
Ron and Hermione, he was spending a lot of time with 
his mouth shut tight. 

“I never promised Hermione anything,” Ron mumbled. 
“I mean, all right, I was going to go to Slughorn’s 
Christmas party with her, but she never said ... just 
as friends ... I’m a free agent. ...” 

Harry turned a page of Quintessence, aware that Ron 
was watching him. Ron’s voice tailed away in mutters, 
barely audible over the loud crackling of the fire, 
though Harry thought he caught the words “Krum” 
and “can’t complain” again. 

Hermione’s schedule was so full that Harry could only 
talk to her properly in the evenings, when Ron was, in 

Page | 341 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




any case, so tightly wrapped around Lavender that he 
did not notice what Harry was doing. Hermione 
refused to sit in the common room while Ron was 
there, so Harry generally joined her in the library, 
which meant that their conversations were held in 
whispers. 

“He’s at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes,” 
said Hermione, while the librarian, Madam Pince, 
prowled the shelves behind them. “I really couldn’t 
care less.” 

She raised her quill and dotted an i so ferociously 
that she punctured a hole in her parchment. Harry 
said nothing. He thought his voice might soon vanish 
from lack of use. He bent a little lower over Advanced 
Potion-Making and continued to make notes on 
Everlasting Elixirs, occasionally pausing to decipher 
the Prince’s useful additions to Libatius Borage’s text. 

“And incidentally,” said Hermione, after a few 
moments, “you need to be careful.” 

“For the last time,” said Harry, speaking in a slightly 
hoarse whisper after three-quarters of an hour of 
silence, “I am not giving back this book, I’ve learned 
more from the Half-Blood Prince than Snape or 
Slughorn have taught me in — ” 

“I’m not talking about your stupid so-called Prince,” 
said Hermione, giving his book a nasty look as though 
it had been rude to her. “I’m talking about earlier. I 
went into the girls’ bathroom just before I came in 
here and there were about a dozen girls in there, 
including that Romilda Vane, trying to decide how to 
slip you a love potion. They’re all hoping they’re going 
to get you to take them to Slughorn ’s party, and they 
all seem to have bought Fred and George’s love 
potions, which I’m afraid to say probably work — ” 
Page | 342 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Why didn’t you confiscate them then?” demanded 
Harry. It seemed extraordinary that Hermione’s mania 
for upholding rules could have abandoned her at this 
crucial juncture. 

“They didn’t have the potions with them in the 
bathroom,” said Hermione scornfully. “They were just 
discussing tactics. As I doubt whether even the Half- 
Blood Prince ” — she gave the book another nasty look 
— “could dream up an antidote for a dozen different 
love potions at once, I’d just invite someone to go with 
you, thatll stop all the others thinking they’ve still got 
a chance. It’s tomorrow night, they’re getting 
desperate.” 

“There isn’t anyone I want to invite,” mumbled Harry, 
who was still trying not to think about Ginny any 
more than he could help, despite the fact that she 
kept cropping up in his dreams in ways that made 
him devoutly thankful that Ron could not perform 
Legilimency. 

“Well, just be careful what you drink, because 
Romilda Vane looked like she meant business,” said 
Hermione grimly. 

She hitched up the long roll of parchment on which 
she was writing her Arithmancy essay and continued 
to scratch away with her quill. Harry watched her 
with his mind a long way away. 

“Hang on a moment,” he said slowly. “I thought Filch 
had banned anything bought at Weasleys’ Wizard 
Wheezes?” 

“And when has anyone ever paid attention to what 
Filch has banned?” asked Hermione, still 
concentrating on her essay. 



Page | 343 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“But I thought all the owls were being searched. So 
how come these girls are able to bring love potions 
into school?” 

“Fred and George send them disguised as perfumes 
and cough potions,” said Hermione. “It’s part of their 
Owl Order Service.” 

“You know a lot about it.” 

Hermione gave him the kind of nasty look she had 
just given his copy of Advanced Potion-Making. 

“It was all on the back of the bottles they showed 
Ginny and me in the summer,” she said coldly. “I 
don’t go around putting potions in people’s drinks ... 
or pretending to, either, which is just as bad. ...” 

“Yeah, well, never mind that,” said Harry quickly. 

“The point is, Filch is being fooled, isn’t he? These 
girls are getting stuff into the school disguised as 
something else! So why couldn’t Malfoy have brought 
the necklace into the school — ?” 

“Oh, Harry ... not that again ...” 

“Come on, why not?” demanded Harry. 

“Look,” sighed Hermione, “Secrecy Sensors detect 
jinxes, curses, and concealment charms, don’t they? 
They’re used to find Dark Magic and Dark objects. 
They’d have picked up a powerful curse, like the one 
on that necklace, within seconds. But something 
that’s just been put in the wrong bottle wouldn’t 
register — and anyway, love potions aren’t Dark or 
dangerous — ” 

“Easy for you to say,” muttered Harry, thinking of 
Romilda Vane. 

Page | 344 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“ — so it would be down to Filch to realize it wasn’t a 
cough potion, and he’s not a very good wizard, I doubt 
he can tell one potion from — ” 

Hermione stopped dead; Harry had heard it too. 
Somebody had moved close behind them among the 
dark bookshelves. They waited, and a moment later 
the vulturelike countenance of Madam Pince 
appeared around the corner, her sunken cheeks, her 
skin like parchment, and her long hooked nose 
illuminated unflatteringly by the lamp she was 
carrying. 

“The library is now closed,” she said. “Mind you 
return anything you have borrowed to the correct — 
what have you been doing to that book, you depraved 
boy?” 

“It isn’t the library’s, it’s mine!” said Harry hastily, 
snatching his copy of Advanced Potion-Making off the 
table as she lunged at it with a clawlike hand. 

“Despoiled!” she hissed. “Desecrated! Befouled!” 

“It’s just a book that’s been written on!” said Harry, 
tugging it out of her grip. 

She looked as though she might have a seizure; 
Hermione, who had hastily packed her things, 
grabbed Harry by the arm and frogmarched him 
away. 

“She’ll ban you from the library if you’re not careful. 
Why did you have to bring that stupid book?” 

“It’s not my fault she’s barking mad, Hermione. Or 
d’you think she overheard you being rude about 
Filch? I’ve always thought there might be something 
going on between them. ...” 

Page | 345 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Oh, ha ha ...” 



Enjoying the fact that they could speak normally 
again, they made their way along the deserted, lamp- 
lit corridors back to the common room, arguing about 
whether or not Filch and Madam Pince were secretly 
in love with each other. 

“Baubles,” said Harry to the Fat Lady, this being the 
new, festive password. 

“Same to you,” said the Fat Lady with a roguish grin, 
and she swung forward to admit them. 

“Hi, Harry!” said Romilda Vane, the moment he had 
climbed through the portrait hole. “Fancy a 
gillywater?” 

Hermione gave him a “what-did-I-tell-you?” look over 
her shoulder. 

“No thanks,” said Harry quickly. “I don’t like it much.” 

“Well, take these anyway,” said Romilda, thrusting a 
box into his hands. “Chocolate Cauldrons, they’ve got 
firewhisky in them. My gran sent them to me, but I 
don’t like them.” 

“Oh — right — thanks a lot,” said Harry, who could 
not think what else to say. “Er — I’m just going over 
here with ...” 

He hurried off behind Hermione, his voice tailing 
away feebly. 

“Told you,” said Hermione succinctly. “Sooner you ask 
someone, sooner they’ll all leave you alone and you 
can — ” 



Page | 346 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




But her face suddenly turned blank; she had just 
spotted Ron and Lavender, who were entwined in the 
same armchair. 

“Well, good night, Harry,” said Hermione, though it 
was only seven o’clock in the evening, and she left for 
the girls’ dormitory without another word. 

Harry went to bed comforting himself that there was 
only one more day of lessons to struggle through, 
plus Slughorn’s party, after which he and Ron would 
depart together for the Burrow. It now seemed 
impossible that Ron and Hermione would make up 
with each other before the holidays began, but 
perhaps, somehow, the break would give them time to 
calm down, think better of their behavior. . . . 

But his hopes were not high, and they sank still lower 
after enduring a Transfiguration lesson with them 
both next day. They had just embarked upon the 
immensely difficult topic of human Transfiguration; 
working in front of mirrors, they were supposed to be 
changing the color of their own eyebrows. Hermione 
laughed unkindly at Ron’s disastrous first attempt, 
during which he somehow managed to give himself a 
spectacular handlebar mustache; Ron retaliated by 
doing a cruel but accurate impression of Hermione 
jumping up and down in her seat every time Professor 
McGonagall asked a question, which Lavender and 
Parvati found deeply amusing and which reduced 
Hermione to the verge of tears again. She raced out of 
the classroom on the bell, leaving half her things 
behind; Harry, deciding that her need was greater 
than Ron’s just now, scooped up her remaining 
possessions and followed her. 

He finally tracked her down as she emerged from a 
girls’ bathroom on the floor below. She was 



Page | 347 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




accompanied by Luna Lovegood, who was patting her 
vaguely on the back. 

“Oh, hello, Harry,” said Luna. “Did you know one of 
your eyebrows is bright yellow?” 

“Hi, Luna. Hermione, you left your stuff. ...” 

He held out her books. 

“Oh yes,” said Hermione in a choked voice, taking her 
things and turning away quickly to hide the fact that 
she was wiping her eyes on her pencil case. “Thank 
you, Harry. Well, I’d better get going. ...” 

And she hurried off, without giving Harry any time to 
offer words of comfort, though admittedly he could 
not think of any. 

“She’s a bit upset,” said Luna. “I thought at first it 
was Moaning Myrtle in there, but it turned out to be 
Hermione. She said something about that Ron 
Weasley. ...” 

“Yeah, they’ve had a row,” said Harry. 

“He says very funny things sometimes, doesn’t he?” 
said Luna, as they set off down the corridor together. 
“But he can be a bit unkind. I noticed that last year.” 

“I s’pose,” said Harry. Luna was demonstrating her 
usual knack of speaking uncomfortable truths; he 
had never met anyone quite like her. “So have you 
had a good term?” 

“Oh, it’s been all right,” said Luna. “A bit lonely 
without the D.A. Ginny’s been nice, though. She 
stopped two boys in our Transfiguration class calling 
me ‘Loony’ the other day — ” 

Page | 348 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“How would you like to come to Slughorn’s party with 
me tonight?” 

The words were out of Harry’s mouth before he could 
stop them; he heard himself say them as though it 
were a stranger speaking. 

Luna turned her protuberant eyes upon him in 
surprise. 

“Slughorn’s party? With you?” 

“Yeah,” said Harry. “We’re supposed to bring guests, 
so I thought you might like ... I mean ...” He was keen 
to make his intentions perfectly clear. “I mean, just as 
friends, you know. But if you don’t want to ...” 

He was already half hoping that she didn’t want to. 

“Oh, no, I’d love to go with you as friends!” said Luna, 
beaming as he had never seen her beam before. 
“Nobody’s ever asked me to a party before, as a friend! 
Is that why you dyed your eyebrow, for the party? 
Should I do mine too?” 

“No,” said Harry firmly, “that was a mistake. I’ll get 
Hermione to put it right for me. So, I’ll meet you in 
the entrance hall at eight o’clock then.” 

“AHA!” screamed a voice from overhead and both of 
them jumped; unnoticed by either of them, they had 
just passed right underneath Peeves, who was 
hanging upside down from a chandelier and grinning 
maliciously at them. 

“ Potty asked Loony to go to the partyl Potty lurves 
Loony ! Potty luuuuurves LooooooonyV’ 



Page | 349 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




And he zoomed away, cackling and shrieking, “Potty 
loves Loony!” 

“Nice to keep these things private,” said Harry. And 
sure enough, in no time at all the whole school 
seemed to know that Harry Potter was taking Luna 
Lovegood to Slughorn’s party. 

“You could’ve taken anyonel” said Ron in disbelief 
over dinner. “Anyonel And you chose Loony 
Lovegood?” 

“Don’t call her that, Ron,” snapped Ginny, pausing 
behind Harry on her way to join friends. “I’m really 
glad you’re taking her, Harry, she’s so excited.” 

And she moved on down the table to sit with Dean. 
Harry tried to feel pleased that Ginny was glad he was 
taking Luna to the party, but could not quite manage 
it. A long way along the table, Hermione was sitting 
alone, playing with her stew. Harry noticed Ron 
looking at her furtively. 

“You could say sorry,” suggested Harry bluntly. 

“What, and get attacked by another flock of 
canaries?” muttered Ron. 

“What did you have to imitate her for?” 

“She laughed at my mustache!” 

“So did I, it was the stupidest thing I’ve ever seen.” 

But Ron did not seem to have heard; Lavender had 
just arrived with Parvati. Squeezing herself in 
between Harry and Ron, Lavender flung her arms 
around Ron’s neck. 



Page | 350 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Hi, Harry,” said Parvati who, like him, looked faintly 
embarrassed and bored by the behavior of their two 
friends. 

“Hi,” said Harry. “How’re you? You’re staying at 
Hogwarts, then? I heard your parents wanted you to 
leave.” 

“I managed to talk them out of it for the time being,” 
said Parvati. “That Katie thing really freaked them 
out, but as there hasn’t been anything since ... Oh, 
hi, Hermione!” 

Parvati positively beamed. Harry could tell that she 
was feeling guilty for having laughed at Hermione in 
Transfiguration. He looked around and saw that 
Hermione was beaming back, if possible even more 
brightly. Girls were very strange sometimes. 

“Hi, Parvati!” said Hermione, ignoring Ron and 
Lavender completely. “Are you going to Slughorn’s 
party tonight?” 

“No invite,” said Parvati gloomily. “I’d love to go, 
though, it sounds like it’s going to be really good. ... 
You’re going, aren’t you?” 

“Yes, I’m meeting Cormac at eight, and we’re — ” 

There was a noise like a plunger being withdrawn 
from a blocked sink and Ron surfaced. Hermione 
acted as though she had not seen or heard anything. 

“ — we’re going up to the party together.” 

“Cormac?” said Parvati. “Cormac McLaggen, you 
mean?” 



Page | 351 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“That’s right,” said Hermione sweetly. “The one who 
almost ’ — she put a great deal of emphasis on the 
word — “became Gryffindor Keeper.” 

“Are you going out with him, then?” asked Parvati, 
wide-eyed. 

“Oh — yes — didn’t you know?” said Hermione, with a 
most un-Hermione-ish giggle. 

“No!” said Parvati, looking positively agog at this piece 
of gossip. “Wow, you like your Quidditch players, 
don’t you? First Krum, then McLaggen ...” 

“I like really good Quidditch players,” Hermione 
corrected her, still smiling. “Well, see you ... Got to go 
and get ready for the party. ...” 

She left. At once Lavender and Parvati put their heads 
together to discuss this new development, with 
everything they had ever heard about McLaggen, and 
all they had ever guessed about Hermione. Ron 
looked strangely blank and said nothing. Harry was 
left to ponder in silence the depths to which girls 
would sink to get revenge. 

When he arrived in the entrance hall at eight o’clock 
that night, he found an unusually large number of 
girls lurking there, all of whom seemed to be staring 
at him resentfully as he approached Luna. She was 
wearing a set of spangled silver robes that were 
attracting a certain amount of giggles from the 
onlookers, but otherwise she looked quite nice. Harry 
was glad, in any case, that she had left off her radish 
earrings, her butterbeer cork necklace, and her 
Spectrespecs. 

“Hi,” he said. “Shall we get going then?” 



Page | 352 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Oh yes,” she said happily. “Where is the party?” 



“Slughorn’s office,” said Harry, leading her up the 
marble staircase away from all the staring and 
muttering. “Did you hear, there’s supposed to be a 
vampire coming?” 

“Rufus Scrimgeour?” asked Luna. 

“I — what?” said Harry, disconcerted. “You mean the 
Minister of Magic?” 

“Yes, he’s a vampire,” said Luna matter-of-factly. 
“Father wrote a very long article about it when 
Scrimgeour first took over from Cornelius Fudge, but 
he was forced not to publish by somebody from the 
Ministry. Obviously, they didn’t want the truth to get 
out!” 

Harry, who thought it most unlikely that Rufus 
Scrimgeour was a vampire, but who was used to Luna 
repeating her father’s bizarre views as though they 
were fact, did not reply; they were already 
approaching Slughorn’s office and the sounds of 
laughter, music, and loud conversation were growing 
louder with every step they took. 

Whether it had been built that way, or because he 
had used magical trickery to make it so, Slughorn’s 
office was much larger than the usual teacher’s 
study. The ceiling and walls had been draped with 
emerald, crimson, and gold hangings, so that it 
looked as though they were all inside a vast tent. The 
room was crowded and stuffy and bathed in the red 
light cast by an ornate golden lamp dangling from the 
center of the ceiling in which real fairies were 
fluttering, each a brilliant speck of light. Loud singing 
accompanied by what sounded like mandolins issued 
from a distant corner; a haze of pipe smoke hung over 
Page | 353 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




several elderly warlocks deep in conversation, and a 
number of house-elves were negotiating their way 
squeakily through the forest of knees, obscured by 
the heavy silver platters of food they were bearing, so 
that they looked like little roving tables. 

“Harry, m’boy!” boomed Slughorn, almost as soon as 
Harry and Luna had squeezed in through the door. 
“Come in, come in, so many people I’d like you to 
meet!” 

Slughorn was wearing a tasseled velvet hat to match 
his smoking jacket. Gripping Harry’s arm so tightly he 
might have been hoping to Disapparate with him, 
Slughorn led him purposefully into the party; Harry 
seized Luna’s hand and dragged her along with him. 

“Harry, I’d like you to meet Eldred Worple, an old 
student of mine, author of Blood Brothers: My Life 
Amongst the Vampires — and, of course, his friend 
Sanguini.” 

Worple, who was a small, stout, bespectacled man, 
grabbed Harry’s hand and shook it enthusiastically; 
the vampire Sanguini, who was tall and emaciated 
with dark shadows under his eyes, merely nodded. He 
looked rather bored. A gaggle of girls was standing 
close to him, looking curious and excited. 

“Harry Potter, I am simply delighted!” said Worple, 
peering shortsightedly up into Harry’s face. “I was 
saying to Professor Slughorn only the other day, 
‘Where is the biography of Harry Potter for which we 
have all been waiting?’ ” 

“Er,” said Harry, “were you?” 

“Just as modest as Horace described!” said Worple. 
“But seriously” — his manner changed; it became 

Page | 354 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




suddenly businesslike — “I would be delighted to 
write it myself — people are craving to know more 
about you, dear boy, craving! If you were prepared to 
grant me a few interviews, say in four- or five-hour 
sessions, why, we could have the book finished within 
months. And all with very little effort on your part, I 
assure you — ask Sanguini here if it isn’t quite — 
Sanguini, stay here\” added Worple, suddenly stern, 
for the vampire had been edging toward the nearby 
group of girls, a rather hungry look in his eye. “Here, 
have a pasty,” said Worple, seizing one from a passing 
elf and stuffing it into Sanguini’s hand before turning 
his attention back to Harry. 

“My dear boy, the gold you could make, you have no 
idea — ” 

“I’m definitely not interested,” said Harry firmly, “and 
I’ve just seen a friend of mine, sorry.” 

He pulled Luna after him into the crowd; he had 
indeed just seen a long mane of brown hair disappear 
between what looked like two members of the Weird 
Sisters. 

“Hermione! HermioneV’ 

“Harry! There you are, thank goodness! Hi, Luna!” 

“What’s happened to you?” asked Harry, for Hermione 
looked distinctly disheveled, rather as though she had 
just fought her way out of a thicket of Devil’s Snare. 

“Oh, I’ve just escaped — I mean, I’ve just left 
Cormac,” she said. “Under the mistletoe,” she added 
in explanation, as Harry continued to look 
questioningly at her. 



Page | 355 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Serves you right for coming with him,” he told her 
severely. 



“I thought he’d annoy Ron most,” said Hermione 
dispassionately. “I debated for a while about 
Zacharias Smith, but I thought, on the whole — ” 

“ You considered Smith?” said Harry, revolted. 

“Yes, I did, and I’m starting to wish I’d chosen him, 
McLaggen makes Grawp look a gentleman. Let’s go 
this way, we’ll be able to see him coming, he’s so tall. 



The three of them made their way over to the other 
side of the room, scooping up goblets of mead on the 
way, realizing too late that Professor Trelawney was 
standing there alone. 

“Hello,” said Luna politely to Professor Trelawney. 

“Good evening, my dear,” said Professor Trelawney, 
focusing upon Luna with some difficulty. Harry could 
smell cooking sherry again. “I haven’t seen you in my 
classes lately. ...” 

“No, I’ve got Firenze this year,” said Luna. 

“Oh, of course,” said Professor Trelawney with an 
angry, drunken titter. “Or Dobbin, as I prefer to think 
of him. You would have thought, would you not, that 
now I am returned to the school Professor 
Dumbledore might have got rid of the horse? But no 
... we share classes. ... It’s an insult, frankly, an 
insult. Do you know ...” 

Professor Trelawney seemed too tipsy to have 
recognized Harry. Under cover of her furious 
criticisms of Firenze, Harry drew closer to Hermione 

Page | 356 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




and said, “Let’s get something straight. Are you 
planning to tell Ron that you interfered at Keeper 
tryouts?” 

Hermione raised her eyebrows. “Do you really think 
I’d stoop that low?” 

Harry looked at her shrewdly. “Hermione, if you can 
ask out McLaggen — ” 

“There’s a difference,” said Hermione with dignity. 

“I’ve got no plans to tell Ron anything about what 
might, or might not, have happened at Keeper 
tryouts.” 

“Good,” said Harry fervently. “Because he’ll just fall 
apart again, and we’ll lose the next match — ” 

“Quidditch!” said Hermione angrily. “Is that all boys 
care about? Cormac hasn’t asked me one single 
question about myself, no, I’ve just been treated to ‘A 
Hundred Great Saves Made by Cormac McLaggen’ 
nonstop ever since — oh no, here he comes!” 

She moved so fast it was as though she had 
Disapparated; one moment she was there, the next, 
she had squeezed between two guffawing witches and 
vanished. 

“Seen Hermione?” asked McLaggen, forcing his way 
through the throng a minute later. 

“No, sorry,” said Harry, and he turned quickly to join 
in Luna’s conversation, forgetting for a split second to 
whom she was talking. 

“Harry Potter!” said Professor Trelawney in deep, 
vibrant tones, noticing him for the first time. 



Page | 357 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Oh, hello,” said Harry unenthusiastically. 



“My dear boy!” she said in a very carrying whisper. 
“The rumors! The stories! The Chosen One’! Of 
course, I have known for a very long time. ... The 
omens were never good, Harry. . . . But why have you 
not returned to Divination? For you, of all people, the 
subject is of the utmost importance!” 

“Ah, Sybill, we all think our subject’s most 
important!” said a loud voice, and Slughorn appeared 
at Professor Trelawney’s other side, his face very red, 
his velvet hat a little askew, a glass of mead in one 
hand and an enormous mince pie in the other. “But I 
don’t think I’ve ever known such a natural at 
Potions!” said Slughorn, regarding Harry with a fond, 
if bloodshot, eye. “Instinctive, you know — like his 
mother! I’ve only ever taught a few with this kind of 
ability, I can tell you that, Sybill — why even Severus 



And to Harry’s horror, Slughorn threw out an arm 
and seemed to scoop Snape out of thin air toward 
them. 

“Stop skulking and come and join us, Severus!” 
hiccuped Slughorn happily. “I was just talking about 
Harry’s exceptional potion-making! Some credit must 
go to you, of course, you taught him for five years!” 

Trapped, with Slughorn’s arm around his shoulders, 
Snape looked down his hooked nose at Harry, his 
black eyes narrowed. 

“Funny, I never had the impression that I managed to 
teach Potter anything at all.” 

“Well, then, it’s natural ability!” shouted Slughorn. 
“You should have seen what he gave me, first lesson, 

Page | 358 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Draught of Living Death — never had a student 
produce finer on a first attempt, I don’t think even 
you, Severus — ” 

“Really?” said Snape quietly, his eyes still boring into 
Harry, who felt a certain disquiet. The last thing he 
wanted was for Snape to start investigating the 
source of his newfound brilliance at Potions. 

“Remind me what other subjects you’re taking, 

Harry?” asked Slughorn. 

“Defense Against the Dark Arts, Charms, 
Transfiguration, Herbology ...” 

“All the subjects required, in short, for an Auror,” said 
Snape, with the faintest sneer. 

“Yeah, well, that’s what I’d like to do,” said Harry 
defiantly. 

“And a great one you’ll make too!” boomed Slughorn. 

“I don’t think you should be an Auror, Harry,” said 
Luna unexpectedly. Everybody looked at her. “The 
Aurors are part of the Rotfang Conspiracy, I thought 
everyone knew that. They’re working to bring down 
the Ministry of Magic from within using a 
combination of Dark Magic and gum disease.” 

Harry inhaled half his mead up his nose as he started 
to laugh. Really, it had been worth bringing Luna just 
for this. Emerging from his goblet, coughing, sopping 
wet but still grinning, he saw something calculated to 
raise his spirits even higher: Draco Malfoy being 
dragged by the ear toward them by Argus Filch. 

“Professor Slughorn,” wheezed Filch, his jowls aquiver 
and the maniacal light of mischief-detection in his 

Page | 359 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




bulging eyes, “I discovered this boy lurking in an 
upstairs corridor. He claims to have been invited to 
your party and to have been delayed in setting out. 

Did you issue him with an invitation?” 

Malfoy pulled himself free of Filch ’s grip, looking 
furious. 

“All right, I wasn’t invited!” he said angrily. “I was 
trying to gatecrash, happy?” 

“No, I’m not!” said Filch, a statement at complete odds 
with the glee on his face. “You’re in trouble, you are! 
Didn’t the headmaster say that nighttime prowling’s 
out, unless you’ve got permission, didn’t he, eh?” 

“That’s all right, Argus, that’s all right,” said 
Slughorn, waving a hand. “It’s Christmas, and it’s not 
a crime to want to come to a party. Just this once, 
we’ll forget any punishment; you may stay, Draco.” 

Filch ’s expression of outraged disappointment was 
perfectly predictable; but why, Harry wondered, 
watching him, did Malfoy look almost equally 
unhappy? And why was Snape looking at Malfoy as 
though both angry and . . . was it possible? ... a little 
afraid? 

But almost before Harry had registered what he had 
seen, Filch had turned and shuffled away, muttering 
under his breath; Malfoy had composed his face into 
a smile and was thanking Slughorn for his generosity, 
and Snape’s face was smoothly inscrutable again. 

“It’s nothing, nothing,” said Slughorn, waving away 
Malfoy ’s thanks. “I did know your grandfather, after 
all. ...” 



Page | 360 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“He always spoke very highly of you, sir,” said Malfoy 
quickly. “Said you were the best potion-maker he’d 
ever known. ...” 

Harry stared at Malfoy. It was not the sucking-up that 
intrigued him; he had watched Malfoy do that to 
Snape for a long time. It was the fact that Malfoy did, 
after all, look a little ill. This was the first time he had 
seen Malfoy close up for ages; he now saw that Malfoy 
had dark shadows under his eyes and a distinctly 
grayish tinge to his skin. 

“I’d like a word with you, Draco,” said Snape 
suddenly. 

“Oh, now, Severus,” said Slughorn, hiccuping again, 
“it’s Christmas, don’t be too hard — ” 

“I’m his Head of House, and I shall decide how hard, 
or otherwise, to be,” said Snape curtly. “Follow me, 
Draco.” 

They left, Snape leading the way, Malfoy looking 
resentful. Harry stood there for a moment, irresolute, 
then said, “I’ll be back in a bit, Luna — er — 
bathroom.” 

“All right,” she said cheerfully, and he thought he 
heard her, as he hurried off into the crowd, resume 
the subject of the Rotfang Conspiracy with Professor 
Trelawney, who seemed sincerely interested. 

It was easy, once out of the party, to pull his 
Invisibility Cloak out of his pocket and throw it over 
himself, for the corridor was quite deserted. What was 
more difficult was finding Snape and Malfoy. Harry 
ran down the corridor, the noise of his feet masked by 
the music and loud talk still issuing from Slughorn ’s 
office behind him. Perhaps Snape had taken Malfoy to 
Page | 361 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




his office in the dungeons ... or perhaps he was 
escorting him back to the Slytherin common room. ... 
Harry pressed his ear against door after door as he 
dashed down the corridor until, with a great jolt of 
excitement, he crouched down to the keyhole of the 
last classroom in the corridor and heard voices. 

"... cannot afford mistakes, Draco, because if you are 
expelled — ” 

“I didn’t have anything to do with it, all right?” 

“I hope you are telling the truth, because it was both 
clumsy and foolish. Already you are suspected of 
having a hand in it.” 

“Who suspects me?” said Malfoy angrily. “For the last 
time, I didn’t do it, okay? That Bell girl must’ve had 
an enemy no one knows about — don’t look at me like 
that! I know what you’re doing, I’m not stupid, but it 
won’t work — I can stop you!” 

There was a pause and then Snape said quietly, “Ah 
. . . Aunt Bellatrix has been teaching you Occlumency, 

I see. What thoughts are you trying to conceal from 
your master, Draco?” 

“I’m not trying to conceal anything from him, I just 
don’t want you butting in!” 

Harry pressed his ear still more closely against the 
keyhole. ... What had happened to make Malfoy speak 
to Snape like this — Snape, toward whom he had 
always shown respect, even liking? 

“So that is why you have been avoiding me this term? 
You have feared my interference? You realize that, 
had anybody else failed to come to my office when I 
had told them repeatedly to be there, Draco — ” 

Page | 362 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“So put me in detention! Report me to Dumbledore!” 
jeered Malfoy. 

There was another pause. Then Snape said, “You 
know perfectly well that I do not wish to do either of 
those things.” 

“You’d better stop telling me to come to your office 
then!” 

“Listen to me,” said Snape, his voice so low now that 
Harry had to push his ear very hard against the 
keyhole to hear. “I am trying to help you. I swore to 
your mother I would protect you. I made the 
Unbreakable Vow, Draco — ” 

“Looks like you 11 have to break it, then, because I 
don’t need your protection! It’s my job, he gave it to 
me and I’m doing it, I’ve got a plan and it’s going to 
work, it’s just taking a bit longer than I thought it 
would!” 

“What is your plan?” 

“It’s none of your business!” 

“If you tell me what you are trying to do, I can assist 
you — ” 

“I’ve got all the assistance I need, thanks, I’m not 
alone!” 

“You were certainly alone tonight, which was foolish 
in the extreme, wandering the corridors without 
lookouts or backup, these are elementary mistakes — 



“I would’ve had Crabbe and Goyle with me if you 
hadn’t put them in detention!” 

Page | 363 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Keep your voice down!” spat Snape, for Malfoy’s voice 
had risen excitedly. “If your friends Crabbe and Goyle 
intend to pass their Defense Against the Dark Arts 
O.W.L. this time around, they will need to work a 
little harder than they are doing at pres — ” 

“What does it matter?” said Malfoy. “Defense Against 
the Dark Arts — it’s all just a joke, isn’t it, an act? 
Like any of us need protecting against the Dark Arts 



“It is an act that is crucial to success, Draco!” said 
Snape. “Where do you think I would have been all 
these years, if I had not known how to act? Now listen 
to me! You are being incautious, wandering around at 
night, getting yourself caught, and if you are placing 
your reliance in assistants like Crabbe and Goyle — ” 

“They’re not the only ones, I’ve got other people on my 
side, better people!” 

“Then why not confide in me, and I can — ” 

“I know what you’re up to! You want to steal my 
glory!” 

There was another pause, then Snape said coldly, 
“You are speaking like a child. I quite understand 
that your father’s capture and imprisonment has 
upset you, but — ” 

Harry had barely a second’s warning; he heard 
Malfoy’s footsteps on the other side of the door and 
flung himself out of the way just as it burst open; 
Malfoy was striding away down the corridor, past the 
open door of Slughorn’s office, around the distant 
corner, and out of sight. 



Page | 364 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Hardly daring to breathe, Harry remained crouched 
down as Snape emerged slowly from the classroom. 
His expression unfathomable, he returned to the 
party. Harry remained on the floor, hidden beneath 
the cloak, his mind racing. 



Page | 365 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 






A VERY FROSTY CHRISTMAS 

“So Snape was offering to help him? He was definitely 
offering to help him?” 

“If you ask that once more,” said Harry, “I’m going to 
stick this sprout — ” 

“I’m only checking!” said Ron. They were standing 
alone at the Burrow’s kitchen sink, peeling a 
mountain of sprouts for Mrs. Weasley. Snow was 
drifting past the window in front of them. 

“Yes, Snape was offering to help himl” said Harry. “He 
said he’d promised Malfoy’s mother to protect him, 
that he’d made an Unbreakable Oath or something — 



“An Unbreakable Vow?” said Ron, looking stunned. 
“Nah, he can’t have. ... Are you sure?” 

“Yes, I’m sure,” said Harry. “Why, what does it 
mean?” 



Page | 366 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 



“Well, you can’t break an Unbreakable Vow. ...” 

“I’d worked that much out for myself, funnily enough. 
What happens if you break it, then?” 

“You die,” said Ron simply. “Fred and George tried to 
get me to make one when I was about five. I nearly 
did too, I was holding hands with Fred and everything 
when Dad found us. He went mental,” said Ron, with 
a reminiscent gleam in his eyes. “Only time I’ve ever 
seen Dad as angry as Mum. Fred reckons his left 
buttock has never been the same since.” 

“Yeah, well, passing over Fred’s left buttock — ” 

“I beg your pardon?” said Fred’s voice as the twins 
entered the kitchen. 

“Aaah, George, look at this. They’re using knives and 
everything. Bless them.” 

“I’ll be seventeen in two and a bit months’ time,” said 
Ron grumpily, “and then I’ll be able to do it by magic!” 

“But meanwhile,” said George, sitting down at the 
kitchen table and putting his feet up on it, “we can 
enjoy watching you demonstrate the correct use of a 
— whoops-a-daisy!” 

“You made me do that!” said Ron angrily, sucking his 
cut thumb. “You wait, when I’m seventeen — ” 

“I’m sure you’ll dazzle us all with hitherto 
unsuspected magical skills,” yawned Fred. 

“And speaking of hitherto unsuspected skills, 

Ronald,” said George, “what is this we hear from 
Ginny about you and a young lady called — unless 
our information is faulty — Lavender Brown?” 

Page | 367 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Ron turned a little pink, but did not look displeased 
as he turned back to the sprouts. “Mind your own 
business.” 

“What a snappy retort,” said Fred. “I really don’t know 
how you think of them. No, what we wanted to know 
was . . . how did it happen?” 

“What d’you mean?” 

“Did she have an accident or something?” 

“What?” 

“Well, how did she sustain such extensive brain 
damage? Careful, now!” 

Mrs. Weasley entered the room just in time to see Ron 
throw the sprout knife at Fred, who had turned it into 
a paper airplane with one lazy flick of his wand. 

“Ronl” she said furiously. “Don’t you ever let me see 
you throwing knives again!” 

“I won’t,” said Ron, “let you see,” he added under his 
breath, as he turned back to the sprout mountain. 

“Fred, George, I’m sorry, dears, but Remus is arriving 
tonight, so Bill will have to squeeze in with you two.” 

“No problem,” said George. 

“Then, as Charlie isn’t coming home, that just leaves 
Harry and Ron in the attic, and if Fleur shares with 
Ginny — ” 

“ — that’ll make Ginny’s Christmas — ” muttered Fred. 



Page | 368 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“ — everyone should be comfortable. Well, they’ll have 
a bed, anyway,” said Mrs. Weasley, sounding slightly 
harassed. 



“Percy definitely not showing his ugly face, then?” 
asked Fred. 

Mrs. Weasley turned away before she answered. “No, 
he’s busy, I expect, at the Ministry.” 

“Or he’s the world’s biggest prat,” said Fred, as Mrs. 
Weasley left the kitchen. “One of the two. Well, let’s 
get going, then, George.” 

“What are you two up to?” asked Ron. “Can’t you help 
us with these sprouts? You could just use your wand 
and then well be free too!” 

“No, I don’t think we can do that,” said Fred seriously. 
“It’s very character-building stuff, learning to peel 
sprouts without magic, makes you appreciate how 
difficult it is for Muggles and Squibs — ” 

“ — and if you want people to help you, Ron,” added 
George, throwing the paper airplane at him, “I 
wouldn’t chuck knives at them. Just a little hint. 
We’re off to the village, there’s a very pretty girl 
working in the paper shop who thinks my card tricks 
are something marvelous ... almost like real magic. 



“Gits,” said Ron darkly, watching Fred and George 
setting off across the snowy yard. “Would’ve only 
taken them ten seconds and then we could’ve gone 
too.” 

“I couldn’t,” said Harry. “I promised Dumbledore I 
wouldn’t wander off while I’m staying here.” 

Page | 369 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Oh yeah,” said Ron. He peeled a few more sprouts 
and then said, “Are you going to tell Dumbledore what 
you heard Snape and Malfoy saying to each other?” 

“Yep,” said Harry. “I’m going to tell anyone who can 
put a stop to it, and Dumbledore’s top of the list. I 
might have another word with your dad too.” 

“Pity you didn’t hear what Malfoy’s actually doing, 
though.” 

“I couldn’t have done, could I? That was the whole 
point, he was refusing to tell Snape.” 

There was silence for a moment or two, then Ron 
said, “ ’Course, you know what they’ll all say? Dad 
and Dumbledore and all of them? They’ll say Snape 
isn’t really trying to help Malfoy, he was just trying to 
find out what Malfoy’s up to.” 

“They didn’t hear him,” said Harry flatly. “No one’s 
that good an actor, not even Snape.” 

“Yeah ... I’m just saying, though,” said Ron. 

Harry turned to face him, frowning. “You think I’m 
right, though?” 

“Yeah, I do!” said Ron hastily. “Seriously, I do! But 
they’re all convinced Snape’s in the Order, aren’t 
they?” 

Harry said nothing. It had already occurred to him 
that this would be the most likely objection to his new 
evidence; he could hear Hermione now: Obviously, 
Harry, he was pretending to offer help so he could trick 
Malfoy into telling him what he’s doing. ... 



Page | 370 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




This was pure imagination, however, as he had had 
no opportunity to tell Hermione what he had 
overheard. She had disappeared from Slughorn’s 
parry before he returned to it, or so he had been 
informed by an irate McLaggen, and she had already 
gone to bed by the time he returned to the common 
room. As he and Ron had left for the Burrow early the 
next day, he had barely had time to wish her a happy 
Christmas and to tell her that he had some very 
important news when they got back from the 
holidays. He was not entirely sure that she had heard 
him, though; Ron and Lavender had been saying a 
thoroughly nonverbal good-bye just behind him at the 
time. 

Still, even Hermione would not be able to deny one 
thing: Malfoy was definitely up to something, and 
Snape knew it, so Harry felt fully justified in saying “I 
told you so,” which he had done several times to Ron 
already. 

Harry did not get the chance to speak to Mr. Weasley, 
who was working very long hours at the Ministry, 
until Christmas Eve night. The Weasleys and their 
guests were sitting in the living room, which Ginny 
had decorated so lavishly that it was rather like 
sitting in a paper-chain explosion. Fred, George, 

Harry, and Ron were the only ones who knew that the 
angel on top of the tree was actually a garden gnome 
that had bitten Fred on the ankle as he pulled up 
carrots for Christmas dinner. Stupefied, painted gold, 
stuffed into a miniature tutu and with small wings 
glued to its back, it glowered down at them all, the 
ugliest angel Harry had ever seen, with a large bald 
head like a potato and rather hairy feet. 

They were all supposed to be listening to a Christmas 
broadcast by Mrs. Weasley’s favorite singer, Celestina 
Warbeck, whose voice was warbling out of the large 

Page | 371 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




wooden wireless set. Fleur, who seemed to find 
Celestina very dull, was talking so loudly in the 
corner that a scowling Mrs. Weasley kept pointing her 
wand at the volume control, so that Celestina grew 
louder and louder. Under cover of a particularly jazzy 
number called “A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love,” 
Fred and George started a game of Exploding Snap 
with Ginny. Ron kept shooting Bill and Fleur covert 
looks, as though hoping to pick up tips. Meanwhile, 
Remus Lupin, who was thinner and more ragged- 
looking than ever, was sitting beside the fire, staring 
into its depths as though he could not hear 
Celestina’s voice. 

Oh, come and stir my cauldron, 

And if you do it right, 

I’ll boil you up some hot strong love 
To keep you warm tonight. 

“We danced to this when we were eighteen!” said Mrs. 
Weasley, wiping her eyes on her knitting. “Do you 
remember, Arthur?” 

“Mphf?” said Mr. Weasley, whose head had been 
nodding over the satsuma he was peeling. “Oh yes . . . 
marvelous tune ...” 

With an effort, he sat up a little straighter and looked 
around at Harry, who was sitting next to him. 

“Sorry about this,” he said, jerking his head toward 
the wireless as Celestina broke into the chorus. “Be 
over soon.” 

“No problem,” said Harry, grinning. “Has it been busy 
at the Ministry?” 

“Very,” said Mr. Weasley. “I wouldn’t mind if we were 
getting anywhere, but of the three arrests we’ve made 

Page | 372 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




in the last couple of months, I doubt that one of them 
is a genuine Death Eater — only don’t repeat that, 
Harry,” he added quickly, looking much more awake 
all of a sudden. 

“They’re not still holding Stan Shunpike, are they?” 
asked Harry. 

“I’m afraid so,” said Mr. Weasley. “I know 
Dumbledore’s tried appealing directly to Scrimgeour 
about Stan. ... I mean, anybody who has actually 
interviewed him agrees that he’s about as much a 
Death Eater as this satsuma . . . but the top levels 
want to look as though they’re making some progress, 
and ‘three arrests’ sounds better than ‘three mistaken 
arrests and releases’... but again, this is all top 
secret. ...” 

“I won’t say anything,” said Harry. He hesitated for a 
moment, wondering how best to embark on what he 
wanted to say; as he marshaled his thoughts, 
Celestina Warbeck began a ballad called “You 
Charmed the Heart Right Out of Me.” 

“Mr. Weasley, you know what I told you at the station 
when we were setting off for school?” 

“I checked, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley at once. “I went 
and searched the Malfoys’ house. There was nothing, 
either broken or whole, that shouldn’t have been 
there.” 

“Yeah, I know, I saw in the Prophet that you’d looked 
... but this is something different. ... Well, something 
more ...” 

And he told Mr. Weasley everything he had overheard 
between Malfoy and Snape. As Harry spoke, he saw 
Lupin’s head turn a little toward him, taking in every 

Page | 373 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




word. When he had finished, there was silence, except 
for Celestina’s crooning. 

Oh, my poor heart, where has it gone? 

It’s left me for a spell . . . 

“Has it occurred to you, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley, 
“that Snape was simply pretending — ?” 

“Pretending to offer help, so that he could find out 
what Malfoy’s up to?” said Harry quickly. “Yeah, I 
thought you’d say that. But how do we know?” 

“It isn’t our business to know,” said Lupin 
unexpectedly. He had turned his back on the fire now 
and faced Harry across Mr. Weasley. “It’s 
Dumbledore’s business. Dumbledore trusts Severus, 
and that ought to be good enough for all of us.” 

“But,” said Harry, “just say — just say Dumbledore’s 
wrong about Snape — ” 

“People have said it, many times. It comes down to 
whether or not you trust Dumbledore’s judgment. I 
do; therefore, I trust Severus.” 

“But Dumbledore can make mistakes,” argued Harry. 
“He says it himself. And you” — he looked Lupin 
straight in the eye — “do you honestly like Snape?” 

“I neither like nor dislike Severus,” said Lupin. “No, 
Harry, I am speaking the truth,” he added, as Harry 
pulled a skeptical expression. “We shall never be 
bosom friends, perhaps; after all that happened 
between James and Sirius and Severus, there is too 
much bitterness there. But I do not forget that during 
the year I taught at Hogwarts, Severus made the 
Wolfsbane Potion for me every month, made it 
Page | 374 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




perfectly, so that I did not have to suffer as I usually 
do at the full moon.” 

“But he ‘accidentally’ let it slip that you’re a werewolf, 
so you had to leave!” said Harry angrily. 

Lupin shrugged. “The news would have leaked out 
anyway. We both know he wanted my job, but he 
could have wreaked much worse damage on me by 
tampering with the potion. He kept me healthy. I 
must be grateful.” 

“Maybe he didn’t dare mess with the potion with 
Dumbledore watching him!” said Harry. 

“You are determined to hate him, Harry,” said Lupin 
with a faint smile. “And I understand; with James as 
your father, with Sirius as your godfather, you have 
inherited an old prejudice. By all means tell 
Dumbledore what you have told Arthur and me, but 
do not expect him to share your view of the matter; do 
not even expect him to be surprised by what you tell 
him. It might have been on Dumbledore’s orders that 
Severus questioned Draco.” 

... and now you’ve torn it quite apart 

I’ll thank you to give back my heart! 

Celestina ended her song on a very long, high-pitched 
note and loud applause issued out of the wireless, 
which Mrs. Weasley joined in with enthusiastically. 

“Eez eet over?” said Fleur loudly. “Thank goodness, 
what an ’orrible — ” 

“Shall we have a nightcap, then?” asked Mr. Weasley 
loudly, leaping to his feet. “Who wants eggnog?” 



Page | 375 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“What have you been up to lately?” Harry asked 
Lupin, as Mr. Weasley bustled off to fetch the eggnog, 
and everybody else stretched and broke into 
conversation. 

“Oh, I’ve been underground,” said Lupin. “Almost 
literally. That’s why I haven’t been able to write, 

Harry; sending letters to you would have been 
something of a giveaway.” 

“What do you mean?” 

“I’ve been living among my fellows, my equals,” said 
Lupin. “Werewolves,” he added, at Harry’s look of 
incomprehension. “Nearly all of them are on 
Voldemort’s side. Dumbledore wanted a spy and here 
I was ... ready-made.” 

He sounded a little bitter, and perhaps realized it, for 
he smiled more warmly as he went on, “I am not 
complaining; it is necessary work and who can do it 
better than I? However, it has been difficult gaining 
their trust. I bear the unmistakable signs of having 
tried to live among wizards, you see, whereas they 
have shunned normal society and live on the margins, 
stealing — and sometimes killing — to eat.” 

“How come they like Voldemort?” 

“They think that, under his rule, they will have a 
better life,” said Lupin. “And it is hard to argue with 
Grey back out there. ...” 

“Who’s Grey back?” 

“You haven’t heard of him?” Lupin’s hands closed 
convulsively in his lap. “Fenrir Greyback is, perhaps, 
the most savage werewolf alive today. He regards it as 
his mission in life to bite and to contaminate as many 

Page | 376 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




people as possible; he wants to create enough 
werewolves to overcome the wizards. Voldemort has 
promised him prey in return for his services. 

Greyback specializes in children. ... Bite them young, 
he says, and raise them away from their parents, 
raise them to hate normal wizards. Voldemort has 
threatened to unleash him upon people’s sons and 
daughters; it is a threat that usually produces good 
results.” 

Lupin paused and then said, “It was Greyback who 
bit me.” 

“What?” said Harry, astonished. “When — when you 
were a kid, you mean?” 

“Yes. My father had offended him. I did not know, for 
a very long time, the identity of the werewolf who had 
attacked me; I even felt pity for him, thinking that he 
had had no control, knowing by then how it felt to 
transform. But Greyback is not like that. At the full 
moon, he positions himself close to victims, ensuring 
that he is near enough to strike. He plans it all. And 
this is the man Voldemort is using to marshal the 
werewolves. I cannot pretend that my particular 
brand of reasoned argument is making much 
headway against Greyback’s insistence that we 
werewolves deserve blood, that we ought to revenge 
ourselves on normal people.” 

“But you are normal!” said Harry fiercely. “You’ve just 
got a — a problem — ” 

Lupin burst out laughing. “Sometimes you remind me 
a lot of James. He called it my ‘furry little problem’ in 
company. Many people were under the impression 
that I owned a badly behaved rabbit.” 



Page | 377 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




He accepted a glass of eggnog from Mr. Weasley with 
a word of thanks, looking slightly more cheerful. 
Harry, meanwhile, felt a rush of excitement: This last 
mention of his father had reminded him that there 
was something he had been looking forward to asking 
Lupin. 

“Have you ever heard of someone called the Half- 
Blood Prince?” 

“The Half-Blood what?” 

“Prince,” said Harry, watching him closely for signs of 
recognition. 

“There are no Wizarding princes,” said Lupin, now 
smiling. “Is this a title you’re thinking of adopting? I 
should have thought being ‘the Chosen One’ would be 
enough.” 

“It’s nothing to do with me!” said Harry indignantly. 
“The Half-Blood Prince is someone who used to go to 
Hogwarts, I’ve got his old Potions book. He wrote 
spells all over it, spells he invented. One of them was 
Levicorpus — ” 

“Oh, that one had a great vogue during my time at 
Hogwarts,” said Lupin reminiscently. “There were a 
few months in my fifth year when you couldn’t move 
for being hoisted into the air by your ankle.” 

“My dad used it,” said Harry. “I saw him in the 
Pensieve, he used it on Snape.” 

He tried to sound casual, as though this was a 
throwaway comment of no real importance, but he 
was not sure he had achieved the right effect; Lupin’s 
smile was a little too understanding. 



Page | 378 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Yes,” he said, “but he wasn’t the only one. As I say, it 
was very popular. ... You know how these spells come 
and go. ...” 

“But it sounds like it was invented while you were at 
school,” Harry persisted. 

“Not necessarily,” said Lupin. “Jinxes go in and out of 
fashion like everything else.” 

He looked into Harry’s face and then said quietly, 
“James was a pureblood, Harry, and I promise you, 
he never asked us to call him ‘Prince.’ ” 

Abandoning pretense, Harry said, “And it wasn’t 
Sirius? Or you?” 

“Definitely not.” 

“Oh.” Harry stared into the fire. “I just thought — 
well, he’s helped me out a lot in Potions classes, the 
Prince has.” 

“How old is this book, Harry?” 

“I dunno, I’ve never checked.” 

“Well, perhaps that will give you some clue as to when 
the Prince was at Hogwarts,” said Lupin. 

Shortly after this, Fleur decided to imitate Celestina 
singing “A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love,” which 
was taken by everyone, once they had glimpsed Mrs. 
Weasley’s expression, to be the cue to go to bed. 

Harry and Ron climbed all the way up to Ron’s attic 
bedroom, where a camp bed had been added for 
Harry. 



Page | 379 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Ron fell asleep almost immediately, but Harry delved 
into his trunk and pulled out his copy of Advanced 
Potion-Making before getting into bed. There he turned 
its pages, searching, until he finally found, at the 
front of the book, the date that it had been published. 
It was nearly fifty years old. Neither his father, nor his 
father’s friends, had been at Hogwarts fifty years ago. 
Feeling disappointed, Harry threw the book back into 
his trunk, turned off the lamp, and rolled over, 
thinking of werewolves and Snape, Stan Shunpike 
and the Half-Blood Prince, and finally falling into an 
uneasy sleep full of creeping shadows and the cries of 
bitten children. ... 

“She’s got to be joking. ...” 

Harry woke with a start to find a bulging stocking 
lying over the end of his bed. He put on his glasses 
and looked around; the tiny window was almost 
completely obscured with snow and, in front of it, Ron 
was sitting bolt upright in bed and examining what 
appeared to be a thick gold chain. 

“What’s that?” asked Harry. 

“It’s from Lavender,” said Ron, sounding revolted. 

“She can’t honestly think I’d wear ...” 

Harry looked more closely and let out a shout of 
laughter. Dangling from the chain in large gold letters 
were the words: 

My Sweetheart 

“Nice,” he said. “Classy. You should definitely wear it 
in front of Fred and George.” 



Page | 380 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“If you tell them,” said Ron, shoving the necklace out 
of sight under his pillow, “I — I — 111 — ” 

“Stutter at me?” said Harry, grinning. “Come on, 
would I?” 

“How could she think I’d like something like that, 
though?” Ron demanded of thin air, looking rather 
shocked. 

“Well, think back,” said Harry. “Have you ever let it 
slip that you’d like to go out in public with the words 
‘My Sweetheart’ round your neck?” 

“Well ... we don’t really talk much,” said Ron. “It’s 
mainly ...” 

“Snogging,” said Harry. 

“Well, yeah,” said Ron. He hesitated a moment, then 
said, “Is Hermione really going out with McLaggen?” 

“I dunno,” said Harry. “They were at Slughorn’s party 
together, but I don’t think it went that well.” 

Ron looked slightly more cheerful as he delved deeper 
into his stocking. 

Harry’s presents included a sweater with a large 
Golden Snitch worked onto the front, hand-knitted by 
Mrs. Weasley, a large box of Weasleys’ Wizard 
Wheezes products from the twins, and a slightly 
damp, moldy-smelling package that came with a label 
reading TO MASTER, FROM KREACHER. 

Harry stared at it. “D’you reckon this is safe to open?” 
he asked. 



Page | 381 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Can’t be anything dangerous, all our mail’s still 
being searched at the Ministry,” replied Ron, though 
he was eyeing the parcel suspiciously. 

“I didn’t think of giving Kreacher anything. Do people 
usually give their house-elves Christmas presents?” 
asked Harry, prodding the parcel cautiously. 

“Hermione would,” said Ron. “But let’s wait and see 
what it is before you start feeling guilty.” 

A moment later, Harry had given a loud yell and leapt 
out of his camp bed; the package contained a large 
number of maggots. 

“Nice,” said Ron, roaring with laughter. “Very 
thoughtful.” 

“I’d rather have them than that necklace,” said Harry, 
which sobered Ron up at once. 

Everybody was wearing new sweaters when they all 
sat down for Christmas lunch, everyone except Fleur 
(on whom, it appeared, Mrs. Weasley had not wanted 
to waste one) and Mrs. Weasley herself, who was 
sporting a brand-new midnight blue witch’s hat 
glittering with what looked like tiny starlike 
diamonds, and a spectacular golden necklace. 

“Fred and George gave them to me! Aren’t they 
beautiful?” 

“Well, we find we appreciate you more and more, 
Mum, now we’re washing our own socks,” said 
George, waving an airy hand. “Parsnips, Remus?” 

“Harry, you’ve got a maggot in your hair,” said Ginny 
cheerfully, leaning across the table to pick it out; 



Page | 382 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Harry felt goose bumps erupt up his neck that had 
nothing to do with the maggot. 

“ ’Ow ’orrible,” said Fleur, with an affected little 
shudder. 

“Yes, isn’t it?” said Ron. “Gravy, Fleur?” 

In his eagerness to help her, he knocked the gravy 
boat flying; Bill waved his wand and the gravy soared 
up in the air and returned meekly to the boat. 

“You are as bad as zat Tonks,” said Fleur to Ron, 
when she had finished kissing Bill in thanks. “She is 
always knocking — ” 

“I invited dear Tonks to come along today,” said Mrs. 
Weasley, setting down the carrots with unnecessary 
force and glaring at Fleur. “But she wouldn’t come. 
Have you spoken to her lately, Remus?” 

“No, I haven’t been in contact with anybody very 
much,” said Lupin. “But Tonks has got her own 
family to go to, hasn’t she?” 

“Hmmm,” said Mrs. Weasley. “Maybe. I got the 
impression she was planning to spend Christmas 
alone, actually.” 

She gave Lupin an annoyed look, as though it was all 
his fault she was getting Fleur for a daughter-in-law 
instead of Tonks, but Harry, glancing across at Fleur, 
who was now feeding Bill bits of turkey off her own 
fork, thought that Mrs. Weasley was fighting a long- 
lost battle. He was, however, reminded of a question 
he had with regard to Tonks, and who better to ask 
than Lupin, the man who knew all about Patronuses? 



Page | 383 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Tonks’s Patronus has changed its form,” he told him. 
“Snape said so anyway. I didn’t know that could 
happen. Why would your Patronus change?” 

Lupin took his time chewing his turkey and 
swallowing before saying slowly, “Sometimes ... a 
great shock ... an emotional upheaval ...” 

“It looked big, and it had four legs,” said Harry, 
struck by a sudden thought and lowering his voice. 
“Hey ... it couldn’t be — ?” 

“Arthur!” said Mrs. Weasley suddenly. She had risen 
from her chair; her hand was pressed over her heart 
and she was staring out of the kitchen window. 
“Arthur — it’s Percy!” 

“What?” 

Mr. Weasley looked around. Everybody looked quickly 
at the window; Ginny stood up for a better look. 

There, sure enough, was Percy Weasley, striding 
across the snowy yard, his horn-rimmed glasses 
glinting in the sunlight. He was not, however, alone. 

“Arthur, he’s — he’s with the Minister!” 

And sure enough, the man Harry had seen in the 
Daily Prophet was following along in Percy’s wake, 
limping slightly, his mane of graying hair and his 
black cloak flecked with snow. Before any of them 
could say anything, before Mr. and Mrs. Weasley 
could do more than exchange stunned looks, the back 
door opened and there stood Percy. 

There was a moment’s painful silence. Then Percy 
said rather stiffly, “Merry Christmas, Mother.” 



Page | 384 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Oh, Percy\” said Mrs. Weasley, and she threw herself 
into his arms. 



Rufus Scrimgeour paused in the doorway, leaning on 
his walking stick and smiling as he observed this 
affecting scene. 

“You must forgive this intrusion,” he said, when Mrs. 
Weasley looked around at him, beaming and wiping 
her eyes. “Percy and I were in the vicinity — working, 
you know — and he couldn’t resist dropping in and 
seeing you all.” 

But Percy showed no sign of wanting to greet any of 
the rest of the family. He stood, poker-straight and 
awkward-looking, and stared over everybody else’s 
heads. Mr. Weasley, Fred, and George were all 
observing him, stony-faced. 

“Please, come in, sit down, Minister!” fluttered Mrs. 
Weasley, straightening her hat. “Have a little purkey, 
or some tooding. ... I mean — ” 

“No, no, my dear Molly,” said Scrimgeour. Harry 
guessed that he had checked her name with Percy 
before they entered the house. “I don’t want to 
intrude, wouldn’t be here at all if Percy hadn’t wanted 
to see you all so badly. ...” 

“Oh, Perce!” said Mrs. Weasley tearfully, reaching up 
to kiss him. 

"... We’ve only looked in for five minutes, so I’ll have a 
stroll around the yard while you catch up with Percy. 
No, no, I assure you I don’t want to butt in! Well, if 
anybody cared to show me your charming garden . . . 
Ah, that young man’s finished, why doesn’t he take a 
stroll with me?” 

Page | 385 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




The atmosphere around the table changed 
perceptibly. Everybody looked from Scrimgeour to 
Harry. Nobody seemed to find Scrimgeour s pretense 
that he did not know Harry’s name convincing, or find 
it natural that he should be chosen to accompany the 
Minister around the garden when Ginny, Fleur, and 
George also had clean plates. 

“Yeah, all right,” said Harry into the silence. 

He was not fooled; for all Scrimgeour’s talk that they 
had just been in the area, that Percy wanted to look 
up his family, this must be the real reason that they 
had come, so that Scrimgeour could speak to Harry 
alone. 

“It’s fine,” he said quietly, as he passed Lupin, who 
had half risen from his chair. “Fine,” he added, as Mr. 
Weasley opened his mouth to speak. 

“Wonderful!” said Scrimgeour, standing back to let 
Harry pass through the door ahead of him. “We’ll just 
take a turn around the garden, and Percy and I’ll be 
off. Carry on, everyone!” 

Harry walked across the yard toward the Weasleys’ 
overgrown, snow-covered garden, Scrimgeour limping 
slightly at his side. He had, Harry knew, been Head of 
the Auror office; he looked tough and battle-scarred, 
very different from portly Fudge in his bowler hat. 

“Charming,” said Scrimgeour, stopping at the garden 
fence and looking out over the snowy lawn and the 
indistinguishable plants. “Charming.” 

Harry said nothing. He could tell that Scrimgeour was 
watching him. 



Page | 386 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“I’ve wanted to meet you for a very long time,” said 
Scrimgeour, after a few moments. “Did you know 
that?” 

“No,” said Harry truthfully. 

“Oh yes, for a very long time. But Dumbledore has 
been very protective of you,” said Scrimgeour. 
“Natural, of course, natural, after what you’ve been 
through. ... Especially what happened at the Ministry 



He waited for Harry to say something, but Harry did 
not oblige, so he went on, “I have been hoping for an 
occasion to talk to you ever since I gained office, but 
Dumbledore has — most understandably, as I say — 
prevented this.” 

Still, Harry said nothing, waiting. 

“The rumors that have flown around!” said 
Scrimgeour. “Well, of course, we both know how these 
stories get distorted ... all these whispers of a 
prophecy ... of you being ‘the Chosen One’...” 

They were getting near it now, Harry thought, the 
reason Scrimgeour was here. 

"... I assume that Dumbledore has discussed these 
matters with you?” 

Harry deliberated, wondering whether he ought to lie 
or not. He looked at the little gnome prints all around 
the flowerbeds, and the scuffed-up patch that marked 
the spot where Fred had caught the gnome now 
wearing the tutu at the top of the Christmas tree. 
Finally, he decided on the truth ... or a bit of it. 

“Yeah, we’ve discussed it.” 

Page | 387 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Have you, have you ...” said Scrimgeour. Harry could 
see, out of the corner of his eye, Scrimgeour squinting 
at him, so he pretended to be very interested in a 
gnome that had just poked its head out from 
underneath a frozen rhododendron. “And what has 
Dumbledore told you, Harry?” 

“Sorry, but that’s between us,” said Harry. He kept 
his voice as pleasant as he could, and Scrimgeour’s 
tone, too, was light and friendly as he said, “Oh, of 
course, if it’s a question of confidences, I wouldn’t 
want you to divulge ... no, no ... and in any case, does 
it really matter whether you are ‘the Chosen One’ or 
not?” ” 

Harry had to mull that one over for a few seconds 
before responding. “I don’t really know what you 
mean, Minister.” 

“Well, of course, to you it will matter enormously,” 
said Scrimgeour with a laugh. “But to the Wizarding 
community at large ... it’s all perception, isn’t it? It’s 
what people believe that’s important.” 

Harry said nothing. He thought he saw, dimly, where 
they were heading, but he was not going to help 
Scrimgeour get there. The gnome under the 
rhododendron was now digging for worms at its roots, 
and Harry kept his eyes fixed upon it. 

“People believe you are ‘the Chosen One,’ you see,” 
said Scrimgeour. “They think you quite the hero — 
which, of course, you are, Harry, chosen or not! How 
many times have you faced He-Who-Must-Not-Be- 
Named now? Well, anyway,” he pressed on, without 
waiting for a reply, “the point is, you are a symbol of 
hope for many, Harry. The idea that there is 
somebody out there who might be able, who might 
even be destined, to destroy He-Who-Must-Not-Be- 
Page | 388 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Named — well, naturally, it gives people a lift. And I 
can’t help but feel that, once you realize this, you 
might consider it, well, almost a duty, to stand 
alongside the Ministry, and give everyone a boost.” 

The gnome had just managed to get hold of a worm. It 
was now tugging very hard on it, trying to get it out of 
the frozen ground. Harry was silent so long that 
Scrimgeour said, looking from Harry to the gnome, 
“Funny little chaps, aren’t they? But what say you, 
Harry?” 

“I don’t exactly understand what you want,” said 
Harry slowly. “ ‘Stand alongside the Ministry’ ... What 
does that mean?” 

“Oh, well, nothing at all onerous, I assure you,” said 
Scrimgeour. “If you were to be seen popping in and 
out of the Ministry from time to time, for instance, 
that would give the right impression. And of course, 
while you were there, you would have ample 
opportunity to speak to Gawain Robards, my 
successor as Head of the Auror office. Dolores 
Umbridge has told me that you cherish an ambition 
to become an Auror. Well, that could be arranged very 
easily. ...” 

Harry felt anger bubbling in the pit of his stomach: So 
Dolores Umbridge was still at the Ministry, was she? 

“So basically,” he said, as though he just wanted to 
clarify a few points, “you’d like to give the impression 
that I’m working for the Ministry?” 

“It would give everyone a lift to think you were more 
involved, Harry,” said Scrimgeour, sounding relieved 
that Harry had cottoned on so quickly. “ The Chosen 
One,’ you know ... It’s all about giving people hope, 
the feeling that exciting things are happening. ...” 
Page | 389 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“But if I keep running in and out of the Ministry,” 
said Harry, still endeavoring to keep his voice friendly, 
“won’t that seem as though I approve of what the 
Ministry’s up to?” 

“Well,” said Scrimgeour, frowning slightly, “well, yes, 
that’s partly why we’d like — ” 

“No, I don’t think that’ll work,” said Harry pleasantly. 
“You see, I don’t like some of the things the Ministry’s 
doing. Locking up Stan Shunpike, for instance.” 

Scrimgeour did not speak for a moment but his 
expression hardened instantly. “I would not expect 
you to understand,” he said, and he was not as 
successful at keeping anger out of his voice as Harry 
had been. “These are dangerous times, and certain 
measures need to be taken. You are sixteen years old 



“Dumbledore’s a lot older than sixteen, and he doesn’t 
think Stan should be in Azkaban either,” said Harry. 
“You’re making Stan a scapegoat, just like you want 
to make me a mascot.” 

They looked at each other, long and hard. Finally 
Scrimgeour said, with no pretense at warmth, “I see. 
You prefer — like your hero, Dumbledore — to 
disassociate yourself from the Ministry?” 

“I don’t want to be used,” said Harry. 

“Some would say it’s your duty to be used by the 
Ministry!” 

“Yeah, and others might say it’s your duty to check 
that people really are Death Eaters before you chuck 
them in prison,” said Harry, his temper rising now. 
“You’re doing what Barty Crouch did. You never get it

right, you people, do you? Either we’ve got Fudge, 
pretending everything’s lovely while people get 
murdered right under his nose, or we’ve got you, 
chucking the wrong people into jail and trying to 
pretend you’ve got ‘the Chosen One’ working for you!” 

“So you’re not ‘the Chosen One’?” said Scrimgeour. 

“I thought you said it didn’t matter either way?” said 
Harry, with a bitter laugh. “Not to you anyway.” 

“I shouldn’t have said that,” said Scrimgeour quickly. 
“It was tactless — ” 

“No, it was honest,” said Harry. “One of the only 
honest things you’ve said to me. You don’t care 
whether I live or die, but you do care that I help you 
convince everyone you’re winning the war against 
Voldemort. I haven’t forgotten, Minister. ...” 

He raised his right fist. There, shining white on the 
back of his cold hand, were the scars which Dolores 
Umbridge had forced him to carve into his own flesh: / 
must not tell lies. 

“I don’t remember you rushing to my defense when I 
was trying to tell everyone Voldemort was back. The 
Ministry wasn’t so keen to be pals last year.” 

They stood in silence as icy as the ground beneath 
their feet. The gnome had finally managed to extricate 
his worm and was now sucking on it happily, leaning 
against the bottommost branches of the 
rhododendron bush. 

“What is Dumbledore up to?” said Scrimgeour 
brusquely. “Where does he go when he is absent from 
Hogwarts?”

“No idea,” said Harry. 

“And you wouldn’t tell me if you knew,” said 
Scrimgeour, “would you?” 

“No, I wouldn’t,” said Harry. 

“Well, then, I shall have to see whether I can’t find out 
by other means.” 

“You can try,” said Harry indifferently. “But you seem 
cleverer than Fudge, so I’d have thought you’d have 
learned from his mistakes. He tried interfering at 
Hogwarts. You might have noticed he’s not Minister 
anymore, but Dumbledore’s still headmaster. I’d leave 
Dumbledore alone, if I were you.” 

There was a long pause. 

“Well, it is clear to me that he has done a very good 
job on you,” said Scrimgeour, his eyes cold and hard 
behind his wire-rimmed glasses. “Dumbledore’s man 
through and through, aren’t you, Potter?” 

“Yeah, I am,” said Harry. “Glad we straightened that 
out.” 

And turning his back on the Minister of Magic, he 
strode back toward the house.

A SLUGGISH MEMORY 

Late in the afternoon, a few days after New Year, 
Harry, Ron, and Ginny lined up beside the kitchen 
fire to return to Hogwarts. The Ministry had arranged 
this one-off connection to the Floo Network to return 
students quickly and safely to the school. Only Mrs. 
Weasley was there to say good-bye, as Mr. Weasley, 
Fred, George, Bill, and Fleur were all at work. Mrs. 
Weasley dissolved into tears at the moment of parting. 
Admittedly, it took very little to set her off lately; she 
had been crying on and off ever since Percy had 
stormed from the house on Christmas Day with his 
glasses splattered with mashed parsnip (for which 
Fred, George, and Ginny all claimed credit). 

“Don’t cry, Mum,” said Ginny, patting her on the back 
as Mrs. Weasley sobbed into her shoulder. “It’s okay. 



“Yeah, don’t worry about us,” said Ron, permitting his 
mother to plant a very wet kiss on his cheek, “or

about Percy. He’s such a prat, it’s not really a loss, is 
it?” 



Mrs. Weasley sobbed harder than ever as she 
enfolded Harry in her arms. 

“Promise me you’ll look after yourself. ... Stay out of 
trouble. ...” 

“I always do, Mrs. Weasley,” said Harry. “I like a quiet 
life, you know me.” 

She gave a watery chuckle and stood back. “Be good, 
then, all of you. ...” 

Harry stepped into the emerald fire and shouted 
“Hogwarts!” He had one last fleeting view of the 
Weasleys’ kitchen and Mrs. Weasley’s tearful face 
before the flames engulfed him; spinning very fast, he 
caught blurred glimpses of other Wizarding rooms, 
which were whipped out of sight before he could get a 
proper look; then he was slowing down, finally 
stopping squarely in the fireplace in Professor 
McGonagall’s office. She barely glanced up from her 
work as he clambered out over the grate. 

“Evening, Potter. Try not to get too much ash on the 
carpet.” 

“No, Professor.” 

Harry straightened his glasses and flattened his hair 
as Ron came spinning into view. When Ginny had 
arrived, all three of them trooped out of McGonagall’s 
office and off toward Gryffindor Tower. Harry glanced 
out of the corridor windows as they passed; the sun 
was already sinking over grounds carpeted in deeper 
snow than had lain over the Burrow garden. In the

distance, he could see Hagrid feeding Buckbeak in 
front of his cabin. 



“Baubles,” said Ron confidently, when they reached 
the Fat Lady, who was looking rather paler than 
usual and winced at his loud voice. 

“No,” she said. 

“What d’you mean, ‘no’?” 

“There is a new password,” she said. “And please 
don’t shout.” 

“But we’ve been away, how’re we supposed to — ?” 
“Harry! Ginny!” 

Hermione was hurrying toward them, very pink-faced 
and wearing a cloak, hat, and gloves. 

“I got back a couple of hours ago, I’ve just been down 
to visit Hagrid and Buck — I mean Witherwings,” she 
said breathlessly. “Did you have a good Christmas?” 

“Yeah,” said Ron at once, “pretty eventful, Rufus 
Scrim — ” 

“I’ve got something for you, Harry,” said Hermione, 
neither looking at Ron nor giving any sign that she 
had heard him. “Oh, hang on — password. 
Abstinence.” 

“Precisely,” said the Fat Lady in a feeble voice, and 
swung forward to reveal the portrait hole. 

“What’s up with her?” asked Harry.
