J.K. ROWLING - HARRY POTTER 

DUDLEY DEMENTED 

The hottest day of the summer so far was drawing to 
a close and a drowsy silence lay over the large, square 
houses of Privet Drive. Cars that were usually 
gleaming stood dusty in their drives and lawns that 
were once emerald green lay parched and yellowing; 
the use of hosepipes had been banned due to 
drought. Deprived of their usual car-washing and 
lawn-mowing pursuits, the inhabitants of Privet Drive 
had retreated into the shade of their cool houses, 
windows thrown wide in the hope of tempting in a 
nonexistent breeze. The only person left outdoors was 
a teenage boy who was lying flat on his back in a 
flower bed outside number four. 

He was a skinny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who 
had the pinched, slightly unhealthy look of someone 
who has grown a lot in a short space of time. His 
jeans were torn and dirty, his T-shirt baggy and 
faded, and the soles of his trainers were peeling away 
from the uppers. Harry Potter’s appearance did not 
endear him to the neighbors, who were the sort of 
people who thought scruffiness ought to be

punishable by law, but as he had hidden himself 
behind a large hydrangea bush this evening he was 
quite invisible to passersby. In fact, the only way he 
would be spotted was if his Uncle Vernon or Aunt 
Petunia stuck their heads out of the living room 
window and looked straight down into the flower bed 
below. 

On the whole, Harry thought he was to be 
congratulated on his idea of hiding here. He was not, 
perhaps, very comfortable lying on the hot, hard 
earth, but on the other hand, nobody was glaring at 
him, grinding their teeth so loudly that he could not 
hear the news, or shooting nasty questions at him, as 
had happened every time he had tried sitting down in 
the living room and watching television with his aunt 
and uncle. 

Almost as though this thought had fluttered through 
the open window, Vernon Dursley, Harry’s uncle, 
suddenly spoke. “Glad to see the boy’s stopped trying 
to butt in. Where is he anyway?” 

“I don’t know,” said Aunt Petunia unconcernedly. “Not 
in the house.” 

Uncle Vernon grunted. 

“Watching the news ...” he said scathingly. “I’d like to 
know what he’s really up to. As if a normal boy cares 
what’s on the news — Dudley hasn’t got a clue what’s 
going on, doubt he knows who the Prime Minister is! 
Anyway, it’s not as if there ’d be anything about his lot 
on our news — ” 

“Vernon, shh\” said Aunt Petunia. “The window’s 
open!” 

“Oh — yes — sorry, dear ...” 

Page | 3 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




The Dursleys fell silent. Harry listened to a jingle 
about Fruit ’N Bran breakfast cereal while he watched 
Mrs. Figg, a batty, cat-loving old lady from nearby 
Wisteria Walk, amble slowly past. She was frowning 
and muttering to herself. Harry was very pleased that 
he was concealed behind the bush; Mrs. Figg had 
recently taken to asking him around for tea whenever 
she met him in the street. She had rounded the 
corner and vanished from view before Uncle Vernon’s 
voice floated out of the window again. 

“Dudders out for tea?” 

“At the Polkisses’,” said Aunt Petunia fondly. “He’s got 
so many little friends, he’s so popular ...” 

Harry repressed a snort with difficulty. The Dursleys 
really were astonishingly stupid about their son, 
Dudley; they had swallowed all his dim-witted lies 
about having tea with a different member of his gang 
every night of the summer holidays. Harry knew 
perfectly well that Dudley had not been to tea 
anywhere; he and his gang spent every evening 
vandalizing the play park, smoking on street corners, 
and throwing stones at passing cars and children. 
Harry had seen them at it during his evening walks 
around Little Whinging; he had spent most of the 
holidays wandering the streets, scavenging 
newspapers from bins along the way. 

The opening notes of the music that heralded the 
seven o’clock news reached Harry’s ears and his 
stomach turned over. Perhaps tonight — after a 
month of waiting — would be the night — 

“Record numbers of stranded holidaymakers fill 
airports as the Spanish baggage-handlers’ strike 
reaches its second week — ” 



Page | 4 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




“Give ’em a lifelong siesta, I would,” snarled Uncle 
Vernon over the end of the newsreader’s sentence, 
but no matter: Outside in the flower bed, Harry’s 
stomach seemed to unclench. If anything had 
happened, it would surely have been the first item on 
the news; death and destruction were more important 
than stranded holidaymakers... 

He let out a long, slow breath and stared up at the 
brilliant blue sky. Every day this summer had been 
the same: the tension, the expectation, the temporary 
relief, and then mounting tension again . . . and 
always, growing more insistent all the time, the 
question of why nothing had happened yet... 

He kept listening, just in case there was some small 
clue, not recognized for what it really was by the 
Muggles — an unexplained disappearance, 
perhaps, or some strange accident ... but the 
baggage-handlers’ strike was followed by news on the 
drought in the Southeast (“I hope he’s listening next 
door!” bellowed Uncle Vernon, “with his sprinklers on 
at three in the morning!”); then a helicopter that had 
almost crashed in a field in Surrey, then a famous 
actress’s divorce from her famous husband (“as if 
we’re interested in their sordid affairs,” sniffed Aunt 
Petunia, who had followed the case obsessively in 
every magazine she could lay her bony hands on). 

Harry closed his eyes against the now blazing evening 
sky as the newsreader said, “And finally, Bungy the 
budgie has found a novel way of keeping cool this 
summer. Bungy, who lives at the Five Feathers in 
Barnsley, has learned to water-ski! Mary Dorkins 
went to find out more...” 

Harry opened his eyes again. If they had reached 
water-skiing budgerigars, there was nothing else 
worth hearing. He rolled cautiously onto his front and 

Page | 5 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




raised himself onto his knees and elbows, preparing 
to crawl out from under the window. 

He had moved about two inches when several things 
happened in very quick succession. 

A loud, echoing crack broke the sleepy silence like a 
gunshot; a cat streaked out from under a parked car 
and flew out of sight; a shriek, a bellowed oath, and 
the sound of breaking china came from the Dursleys’ 
living room, and as though Harry had been waiting 
for this signal, he jumped to his feet, at the same time 
pulling from the waistband of his jeans a thin wooden 
wand as if he were unsheathing a sword. But before 
he could draw himself up to full height, the top of his 
head collided with the Dursleys’ open window, and 
the resultant crash made Aunt Petunia scream even 
louder. 

Harry felt as if his head had been split in two; eyes 
streaming, he swayed, trying to focus on the street 
and spot the source of the noise, but he had barely 
staggered upright again when two large purple hands 
reached through the open window and closed tightly 
around his throat. 

“Put — it — away\” Uncle Vernon snarled into Harry’s 
ear. “Now\ Before — anyone — sees!” 

“Get — off — me!” Harry gasped; for a few seconds 
they struggled, Harry pulling at his uncle’s sausage- 
like fingers with his left hand, his right maintaining a 
firm grip on his raised wand. Then, as the pain in the 
top of Harry’s head gave a particularly nasty throb, 
Uncle Vernon yelped and released Harry as though he 
had received an electric shock — some invisible force 
seemed to have surged through his nephew, making 
him impossible to hold. 



Page | 6 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Panting, Harry fell forward over the hydrangea bush, 
straightened up, and stared around. There was no 
sign of what had caused the loud cracking noise, but 
there were several faces peering through various 
nearby windows. Harry stuffed his wand hastily back 
into his jeans and tried to look innocent. 

“Lovely evening!” shouted Uncle Vernon, waving at 
Mrs. Number Seven, who was glaring from behind her 
net curtains. “Did you hear that car backfire just 
now? Gave Petunia and me quite a turn!” 

He continued to grin in a horrible, manic way until all 
the curious neighbors had disappeared from their 
various windows, then the grin became a grimace of 
rage as he beckoned Harry back toward him. 

Harry moved a few steps closer, taking care to stop 
just short of the point at which Uncle Vernon’s 
outstretched hands could resume their strangling. 

“What the devil do you mean by it, boy?” asked Uncle 
Vernon in a croaky voice that trembled with fury. 

“What do I mean by what?” said Harry coldly. He kept 
looking left and right up the street, still hoping to see 
the person who had made the cracking noise. 

“Making a racket like a starting pistol right outside 
our — ” 

“I didn’t make that noise,” said Harry firmly. 

Aunt Petunia’s thin, horsey face now appeared beside 
Uncle Vernon’s wide, purple one. She looked livid. 

“Why were you lurking under our window?” 



Page | 7 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Yes — yes, good point, Petunia! What were you doing 
under our window, boy?” 

“Listening to the news,” said Harry in a resigned 
voice. 

His aunt and uncle exchanged looks of outrage. 

“Listening to the news! Again?” 

“Well, it changes every day, you see,” said Harry. 

“Don’t you be clever with me, boy! I want to know 
what you’re really up to — and don’t give me any 
more of this listening to the news tosh! You know 
perfectly well that your lot ...” 

“Careful, Vernon!” breathed Aunt Petunia, and Uncle 
Vernon lowered his voice so that Harry could barely 
hear him, "... that your lot don’t get on our news!” 

“That’s all you know,” said Harry. 

The Dursleys goggled at him for a few seconds, then 
Aunt Petunia said, “You’re a nasty little liar. What are 
all those — ” she too lowered her voice so that Harry 
had to lip-read the next word, “ — owls — doing if 
they’re not bringing you news?” 

“Aha!” said Uncle Vernon in a triumphant whisper. 
“Get out of that one, boy! As if we didn’t know you get 
all your news from those pestilential birds!” 

Harry hesitated for a moment. It cost him something 
to tell the truth this time, even though his aunt and 
uncle could not possibly know how bad Harry felt at 
admitting it. 



Page | 8 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“The owls ... aren’t bringing me news,” said Harry 
tonelessly. 

“I don’t believe it,” said Aunt Petunia at once. 

“No more do I,” said Uncle Vernon forcefully. 

“We know you’re up to something funny,” said Aunt 
Petunia. 

“We’re not stupid, you know,” said Uncle Vernon. 

“Well, that’s news to me,” said Harry, his temper 
rising, and before the Dursleys could call him back, 
he had wheeled about, crossed the front lawn, 
stepped over the low garden wall, and was striding off 
up the street. 

He was in trouble now and he knew it. He would have 
to face his aunt and uncle later and pay the price for 
his rudeness, but he did not care very much just at 
the moment; he had much more pressing matters on 
his mind. 

Harry was sure that the cracking noise had been 
made by someone Apparating or Disapparating. It 
was exactly the sound Dobby the house-elf made 
when he vanished into thin air. Was it possible that 
Dobby was here in Privet Drive? Could Dobby be 
following him right at this very moment? As this 
thought occurred he wheeled around and stared back 
down Privet Drive, but it appeared to be completely 
deserted again and Harry was sure that Dobby did 
not know how to become invisible... 

He walked on, hardly aware of the route he was 
taking, for he had pounded these streets so often 
lately that his feet carried him to his favorite haunts 
automatically. Every few steps he glanced back over 

Page | 9 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




his shoulder. Someone magical had been near him as 
he lay among Aunt Petunias dying begonias, he was 
sure of it. Why hadn’t they spoken to him, why hadn’t 
they made contact, why were they hiding now? 

And then, as his feeling of frustration peaked, his 
certainty leaked away. 

Perhaps it hadn’t been a magical sound after all. 
Perhaps he was so desperate for the tiniest sign of 
contact from the world to which he belonged that he 
was simply overreacting to perfectly ordinary noises. 
Could he be sure it hadn’t been the sound of 
something breaking inside a neighbor’s house? 

Harry felt a dull, sinking sensation in his stomach 
and, before he knew it, the feeling of hopelessness 
that had plagued him all summer rolled over him 
once again... 

Tomorrow morning he would be awoken by the alarm 
at five o’clock so that he could pay the owl that 
delivered the Daily Prophet — but was there any point 
in continuing to take it? Harry merely glanced at the 
front page before throwing it aside these days; when 
the idiots who ran the paper finally realized that 
Voldemort was back it would be headline news, and 
that was the only kind Harry cared about. 

If he was lucky, there would also be owls carrying 
letters from his best friends, Ron and Hermione, 
though any expectation he had had that their letters 
would bring him news had long since been dashed. 

“We can’t say much about you-know-what, 
obviously...” “We’ve been told not to say anything 
important in case our letters go astray...” “We’re quite 
busy but I can’t give you details here...” “There’s a fair 



Page | 10 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




amount going on, we’ll tell you everything when we see 
you...” 

But when were they going to see him? Nobody seemed 
too bothered with a precise date. Hermione had 
scribbled, “I expect we’ll be seeing you quite soon” 
inside his birthday card, but how soon was soon? As 
far as Harry could tell from the vague hints in their 
letters, Hermione and Ron were in the same place, 
presumably at Ron’s parents’ house. He could hardly 
bear to think of the pair of them having fun at the 
Burrow when he was stuck in Privet Drive. In fact, he 
was so angry at them that he had thrown both their 
birthday presents of Honeydukes chocolates away 
unopened, though he had regretted this after eating 
the wilting salad Aunt Petunia had provided for 
dinner that night. 

And what were Ron and Hermione busy with? Why 
wasn’t he, Harry, busy? Hadn’t he proved himself 
capable of handling much more than they? Had they 
all forgotten what he had done? Hadn’t it been he who 
had entered that graveyard and watched Cedric being 
murdered and been tied to that tombstone and nearly 
killed ... ? 

Don’t think about that, Harry told himself sternly for 
the hundredth time that summer. It was bad enough 
that he kept revisiting the graveyard in his 
nightmares, without dwelling on it in his waking 
moments too. 

He turned a corner into Magnolia Crescent; halfway 
along he passed the narrow alleyway down the side of 
a garage where he had first clapped eyes on his 
godfather. Sirius, at least, seemed to understand how 
Harry was feeling; admittedly his letters were just as 
empty of proper news as Ron and Hermione’s, but at 



Page | 11 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




least they contained words of caution and consolation 
instead of tantalizing hints: 

“ I know this must be frustrating for you...” “Keep your 
nose clean and everything will be okay...” “Be careful 
and don’t do anything rash...” 

Well, thought Harry, as he crossed Magnolia 
Crescent, turned into Magnolia Road, and headed 
toward the darkening play park, he had (by and large) 
done as Sirius advised; he had at least resisted the 
temptation to tie his trunk to his broomstick and set 
off for the Burrow by himself. In fact Harry thought 
his behavior had been very good considering how 
frustrated and angry he felt at being stuck in Privet 
Drive this long, reduced to hiding in flower beds in 
the hope of hearing something that might point to 
what Lord Voldemort was doing. Nevertheless, it was 
quite galling to be told not to be rash by a man who 
had served twelve years in the wizard prison, 

Azkaban, escaped, attempted to commit the murder 
he had been convicted for in the first place, then gone 
on the run with a stolen hippogriff. . . 

Harry vaulted over the locked park gate and set off 
across the parched grass. The park was as empty as 
the surrounding streets. When he reached the swings 
he sank onto the only one that Dudley and his friends 
had not yet managed to break, coiled one arm around 
the chain, and stared moodily at the ground. He 
would not be able to hide in the Dursleys’ flower bed 
again. Tomorrow he would have to think of some 
fresh way of listening to the news. In the meantime, 
he had nothing to look forward to but another 
restless, disturbed night, because even when he 
escaped nightmares about Cedric he had unsettling 
dreams about long dark corridors, all finishing in 
dead ends and locked doors, which he supposed had 
something to do with the trapped feeling he had when 
Page | 12 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




he was awake. Often the old scar on his forehead 
prickled uncomfortably, but he did not fool himself 
that Ron or Hermione or Sirius would find that very 
interesting anymore... In the past his scar hurting 
had warned that Voldemort was getting stronger 
again, but now that Voldemort was back they would 
probably remind him that its regular irritation was 
only to be expected... Nothing to worry about ... old 
news ... 

The injustice of it all welled up inside him so that he 
wanted to yell with fury. If it hadn’t been for him, 
nobody would even have known Voldemort was back! 
And his reward was to be stuck in Little Whinging for 
four solid weeks, completely cut off from the magical 
world, reduced to squatting among dying begonias so 
that he could hear about water-skiing budgerigars! 
How could Dumbledore have forgotten him so easily? 
Why had Ron and Hermione got together without 
inviting him along too? How much longer was he 
supposed to endure Sirius telling him to sit tight and 
be a good boy; or resist the temptation to write to the 
stupid Daily Prophet and point out that Voldemort 
had returned? These furious thoughts whirled around 
in Harry’s head, and his insides writhed with anger as 
a sultry, velvety night fell around him, the air full of 
the smell of warm, dry grass and the only sound that 
of the low grumble of traffic on the road beyond the 
park railings. 

He did not know how long he had sat on the swing 
before the sound of voices interrupted his musings 
and he looked up. The street-lamps from the 
surrounding roads were casting a misty glow strong 
enough to silhouette a group of people making their 
way across the park. One of them was singing a loud, 
crude song. The others were laughing. A soft ticking 
noise came from several expensive racing bikes that 
they were wheeling along. 

Page | 13 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Harry knew who those people were. The figure in front 
was unmistakably his cousin, Dudley Dursley, 
wending his way home, accompanied by his faithful 
gang. 

Dudley was as vast as ever, but a year’s hard dieting 
and the discovery of a new talent had wrought quite a 
change in his physique. As Uncle Vernon delightedly 
told anyone who would listen, Dudley had recently 
become the Junior Heavyweight Inter-School Boxing 
Champion of the Southeast. “The noble sport,” as 
Uncle Vernon called it, had made Dudley even more 
formidable than he had seemed to Harry in the 
primary school days when he had served as Dudley’s 
first punching bag. Harry was not remotely afraid of 
his cousin anymore but he still didn’t think that 
Dudley learning to punch harder and more accurately 
was cause for celebration. Neighborhood children all 
around were terrified of him — even more terrified 
than they were of “that Potter boy,” who, they had 
been warned, was a hardened hooligan who attended 
St. Brutus’s Secure Center for Incurably Criminal 
Boys. 

Harry watched the dark figures crossing the grass 
and wondered whom they had been beating up 
tonight. Look round, Harry found himself thinking as 
he watched them. Come on ... look round ... I’m sitting 
here all alone... Come and have ago... 

If Dudley’s friends saw him sitting here, they would 
be sure to make a beeline for him, and what would 
Dudley do then? He wouldn’t want to lose face in 
front of the gang, but he’d be terrified of provoking 
Harry. . . It would be really fun to watch Dudley’s 
dilemma; to taunt him, watch him, with him 
powerless to respond . . . and if any of the others tried 
hitting Harry, Harry was ready — he had his wand . . . 
let them try ... He’d love to vent some of his 
Page | 14 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




frustration on the boys who had once made his life 
hell — 



But they did not turn around, they did not see him, 
they were almost at the railings. Harry mastered the 
impulse to call after them... Seeking a fight was not a 
smart move... He must not use magic... He would be 
risking expulsion again... 

Dudley’s gang’s voices died; they were out of sight, 
heading along Magnolia Road. 

There you go, Sirius, Harry thought dully. Nothing 
rash. Kept my nose clean. Exactly the opposite of what 
you’d have done ... 

He got to his feet and stretched. Aunt Petunia and 
Uncle Vernon seemed to feel that whenever Dudley 
turned up was the right time to be home, and anytime 
after that was much too late. Uncle Vernon had 
threatened to lock Harry in the shed if he came home 
after Dudley again, so, stifling a yawn, still scowling, 
Harry set off toward the park gate. 

Magnolia Road, like Privet Drive, was full of large, 
square houses with perfectly manicured lawns, all 
owned by large, square owners who drove very clean 
cars similar to Uncle Vernon’s. Harry preferred Little 
Whinging by night, when the curtained windows 
made patches of jewel-bright colors in the darkness 
and he ran no danger of hearing disapproving 
mutters about his “delinquent” appearance when he 
passed the householders. He walked quickly, so that 
halfway along Magnolia Road Dudley’s gang came into 
view again; they were saying their farewells at the 
entrance to Magnolia Crescent. Harry stepped into 
the shadow of a large lilac tree and waited. 



Page | 15 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




"... squealed like a pig, didn’t he?” Malcolm was 
saying, to guffaws from the others. 

“Nice right hook, Big D,” said Piers. 

“Same time tomorrow?” said Dudley. 

“Round at my place, my parents are out,” said 
Gordon. 

“See you then,” said Dudley. 

“Bye Dud!” 

“See ya, Big D!” 

Harry waited for the rest of the gang to move on 
before setting off again. When their voices had faded 
once more he headed around the corner into Magnolia 
Crescent and by walking very quickly he soon came 
within hailing distance of Dudley, who was strolling 
along at his ease, humming tunelessly. 

“Hey, Big D!” 

Dudley turned. 

“Oh,” he grunted. “It’s you.” 

“How long have you been ‘Big D’ then?” said Harry. 

“Shut it,” snarled Dudley, turning away again. 

“Cool name,” said Harry, grinning and falling into 
step beside his cousin. “But you’ll always be Ickle 
Diddykins to me.” 

“I said, SHUT IT!” said Dudley, whose ham-like hands 
had curled into fists. 

Page | 16 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Don’t the boys know that’s what your mum calls 
you?” 

“Shut your face.” 

“You don’t tell her to shut her face. What about 
‘popkin’ and ‘Dinky Diddydums,’ can I use them 
then?” 

Dudley said nothing. The effort of keeping himself 
from hitting Harry seemed to be demanding all his 
self-control. 

“So who’ve you been beating up tonight?” Harry 
asked, his grin fading. “Another ten-year-old? I know 
you did Mark Evans two nights ago — ” 

“He was asking for it,” snarled Dudley. 

“Oh yeah?” 

“He cheeked me.” 

“Yeah? Did he say you look like a pig that’s been 
taught to walk on its hind legs? ’Cause that’s not 
cheek, Dud, that’s true ...” 

A muscle was twitching in Dudley’s jaw. It gave Harry 
enormous satisfaction to know how furious he was 
making Dudley; he felt as though he was siphoning 
off his own frustration into his cousin, the only outlet 
he had. 

They turned right down the narrow alleyway where 
Harry had first seen Sirius and which formed a 
shortcut between Magnolia Crescent and Wisteria 
Walk. It was empty and much darker than the streets 
it linked because there were no streetlamps. Their 



Page | 17 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




footsteps were muffled between garage walls on one 
side and a high fence on the other. 

“Think you’re a big man carrying that thing, don’t 
you?” Dudley said after a few seconds. 

“What thing?” 

“That — that thing you’re hiding.” 

Harry grinned again. 

“Not as stupid as you look, are you, Dud? But I s’pose 
if you were, you wouldn’t be able to walk and talk at 
the same time...” 

Harry pulled out his wand. He saw Dudley look 
sideways at it. 

“You’re not allowed,” Dudley said at once. “I know 
you’re not. You’d get expelled from that freak school 
you go to.” 

“How d’you know they haven’t changed the rules, Big 
D?” 

“They haven’t,” said Dudley, though he didn’t sound 
completely convinced. Harry laughed softly. 

“You haven’t got the guts to take me on without that 
thing, have you?” Dudley snarled. 

“Whereas you just need four mates behind you before 
you can beat up a ten-year-old. You know that boxing 
title you keep banging on about? How old was your 
opponent? Seven? Eight?” 

“He was sixteen for your information,” snarled 
Dudley, “and he was out cold for twenty minutes after 

Page | 18 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




I’d finished with him and he was twice as heavy as 
you. You just wait till I tell Dad you had that thing 
out — ” 

“Running to Daddy now, are you? Is his ickle boxing 
champ frightened of nasty Harry’s wand?” 

“Not this brave at night, are you?” sneered Dudley. 

“This is night, Diddykins. That’s what we call it when 
it goes all dark like this.” 

“I mean when you’re in bed!” Dudley snarled. 

He had stopped walking. Harry stopped too, staring at 
his cousin. From the little he could see of Dudley’s 
large face, he was wearing a strangely triumphant 
look. 

“What d’you mean, I’m not brave in bed?” said Harry, 
completely nonplussed. “What — am I supposed to be 
frightened of pillows or something?” 

“I heard you last night,” said Dudley breathlessly. 
“Talking in your sleep. Moaning.” 

“What d’you mean?” Harry said again, but there was 
a cold, plunging sensation in his stomach. He had 
revisited the graveyard last night in his dreams. 

Dudley gave a harsh bark of laughter then adopted a 
high-pitched, whimpering voice. “ ‘Don’t kill Cedric! 
Don’t kill Cedric!’ Who’s Cedric — your boyfriend?” 

“I — you’re lying — ” said Harry automatically. But his 
mouth had gone dry. He knew Dudley wasn’t lying — 
how else would he know about Cedric? 



Page | 19 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“ T)ad! Help me, Dad! He’s going to kill me, Dad! Boo- 
hoo!”’ 

“Shut up,” said Harry quietly. “Shut up, Dudley, I’m 
warning you!” 

“ ‘Come and help me, Dad! Mum, come and help me! 
He’s killed Cedric! Dad, help me! He’s going to — ’ 
Don’t you point that thing at me\” 

Dudley backed into the alley wall. Harry was pointing 
the wand directly at Dudley’s heart. Harry could feel 
fourteen years’ hatred of Dudley pounding in his 
veins — what wouldn’t he give to strike now, to jinx 
Dudley so thoroughly he’d have to crawl home like an 
insect, struck dumb, sprouting feelers — 

“Don’t ever talk about that again,” Harry snarled. 
“D’you understand me?” 

“Point that thing somewhere else!” 

“I said, do you understand me?” 

“Point it somewhere else\” 

“DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?” 

“GET THAT THING AWAY FROM — ” 

Dudley gave an odd, shuddering gasp, as though he 
had been doused in icy water. 

Something had happened to the night. The star- 
strewn indigo sky was suddenly pitch-black and 
lightless — the stars, the moon, the misty streetlamps 
at either end of the alley had vanished. The distant 
grumble of cars and the whisper of trees had gone. 

The balmy evening was suddenly piercingly, bitingly 
Page | 20 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




cold. They were surrounded by total, impenetrable, 
silent darkness, as though some giant hand had 
dropped a thick, icy mantle over the entire alleyway, 
blinding them. 

For a split second Harry thought he had done magic 
without meaning to, despite the fact that he’d been 
resisting as hard as he could — then his reason 
caught up with his senses — he didn’t have the power 
to turn off the stars. He turned his head this way and 
that, trying to see something, but the darkness 
pressed on his eyes like a weightless veil. 

Dudley’s terrified voice broke in Harry’s ear. 

“W-what are you d-doing? St-stop it!” 

“I’m not doing anything! Shut up and don’t move!” 

“I c-can’t see! I’ve g-gone blind! I — ” 

“I said shut up!” 

Harry stood stock-still, turning his sightless eyes left 
and right. The cold was so intense that he was 
shivering all over; goose bumps had erupted up his 
arms, and the hairs on the back of his neck were 
standing up — he opened his eyes to their fullest 
extent, staring blankly around, unseeing . . . 

It was impossible... They couldn’t be here... Not in 
Little Whinging ... He strained his ears... He would 
hear them before he saw them... 

“I’ll t-tell Dad!” Dudley whimpered. “W-where are you? 
What are you d-do — ?” 

“Will you shut up?” Harry hissed, “I’m trying to lis — ” 



Page | 21 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




But he fell silent. He had heard just the thing he had 
been dreading. 



There was something in the alleyway apart from 
themselves, something that was drawing long, hoarse, 
rattling breaths. Harry felt a horrible jolt of dread as 
he stood trembling in the freezing air. 

“C-cut it out! Stop doing it! Ill h-hit you, I swear I 
will!” 

“Dudley, shut — ” 

WHAM 

A fist made contact with the side of Harry’s head, 
lifting Harry off his feet. Small white lights popped in 
front of Harry’s eyes; for the second time in an hour 
he felt as though his head had been cleaved in two; 
next moment he had landed hard on the ground, and 
his wand had flown out of his hand. 

“You moron, Dudley!” Harry yelled, his eyes watering 
with pain, as he scrambled to his hands and knees, 
now feeling around frantically in the blackness. He 
heard Dudley blundering away, hitting the alley fence, 
stumbling. 

“DUDLEY, COME BACK! YOU’RE RUNNING RIGHT 
AT IT!” 

There was a horrible squealing yell, and Dudley’s 
footsteps stopped. At the same moment, Harry felt a 
creeping chill behind him that could mean only one 
thing. There was more than one. 

“DUDLEY, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! WHATEVER 
YOU DO, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! Wand!” Harry 

Page | 22 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




muttered frantically, his hands flying over the ground 
like spiders. “Where’s — wand — come on — Lumosl” 

He said the spell automatically, desperate for light to 
help him in his search — and to his disbelieving 
relief, light flared inches from his right hand — the 
wand tip had ignited. Harry snatched it up, 
scrambled to his feet, and turned around. 

His stomach turned over. 

A towering, hooded figure was gliding smoothly 
toward him, hovering over the ground, no feet or face 
visible beneath its robes, sucking on the night as it 
came. 

Stumbling backward, Harry raised his wand. 

“Expecto Patronurrd” 

A silvery wisp of vapor shot from the tip of the wand 
and the dementor slowed, but the spell hadn’t worked 
properly; tripping over his feet, Harry retreated 
farther as the dementor bore down upon him, panic 
fogging his brain — concentrate — 

A pair of gray, slimy, scabbed hands slid from inside 
the dementor’s robes, reaching for him. A rushing 
noise filled Harry’s ears. 

“Expecto PatronumV’ 

His voice sounded dim and distant... Another wisp of 
silver smoke, feebler than the last, drifted from the 
wand — he couldn’t do it anymore, he couldn’t work 
the spell — 

There was laughter inside his own head, shrill, high- 
pitched laughter... He could smell the dementor’s 

Page | 23 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




putrid, death-cold breath, filling his own lungs, 
drowning him — Think ... something happy... 

But there was no happiness in him... The dementor’s 
icy fingers were closing on his throat — the high- 
pitched laughter was growing louder and louder, and 
a voice spoke inside his head — “Bow to death, 

Harry. . . It might even be painless. . . I would not 
know... I have never died...” 

He was never going to see Ron and Hermione again — 

And their faces burst clearly into his mind as he 
fought for breath — 

“EXPECTO PATRONUM” 

An enormous silver stag erupted from the tip of 
Harry’s wand; its antlers caught the dementor in the 
place where the heart should have been; it was 
thrown backward, weightless as darkness, and as the 
stag charged, the dementor swooped away, batlike 
and defeated. 

“THIS WAY!” Harry shouted at the stag. Wheeling 
around, he sprinted down the alleyway, holding the lit 
wand aloft. “DUDLEY? DUDLEY!” 

He had run barely a dozen steps when he reached 
them: Dudley was curled on the ground, his arms 
clamped over his face; a second dementor was 
crouching low over him, gripping his wrists in its 
slimy hands, prizing them slowly, almost lovingly 
apart, lowering its hooded head toward Dudley’s face 
as though about to kiss him... 

“GET IT!” Harry bellowed, and with a rushing, roaring 
sound, the silver stag he had conjured came galloping 
back past him. The dementor’s eyeless face was 

Page | 24 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




barely an inch from Dudley’s when the silver antlers 
caught it; the thing was thrown up into the air and, 
like its fellow, it soared away and was absorbed into 
the darkness. The stag cantered to the end of the 
alleyway and dissolved into silver mist. 

Moon, stars, and streetlamps burst back into life. A 
warm breeze swept the alleyway. Trees rustled in 
neighboring gardens and the mundane rumble of cars 
in Magnolia Crescent filled the air again. Harry stood 
quite still, all his senses vibrating, taking in the 
abrupt return to normality. After a moment he 
became aware that his T-shirt was sticking to him; he 
was drenched in sweat. 

He could not believe what had just happened. 
Dementors here, in Little Whinging . . . 

Dudley lay curled up on the ground, whimpering and 
shaking. Harry bent down to see whether he was in a 
fit state to stand up, but then heard loud, running 
footsteps behind him; instinctively raising his wand 
again, he spun on his heel to face the newcomer. 

Mrs. Figg, their batty old neighbor, came panting into 
sight. Her grizzled gray hair was escaping from its 
hairnet, a clanking string shopping bag was swinging 
from her wrist, and her feet were halfway out of her 
tartan carpet slippers. Harry made to stow his wand 
hurriedly out of sight, but — 

“Don’t put it away, idiot boy!” she shrieked. “What if 
there are more of them around? Oh, I’m going to kill 
Mundungus Fletcher!” 



Page | 25 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 





A PECK OF OWLS 

“What?” said Harry blankly. 

“He left!” said Mrs. Figg, wringing her hands. “Left to 
see someone about a batch of cauldrons that fell off 
the back of a broom! I told him I’d flay him alive if he 
went, and now look! Dementors! It’s just lucky I put 
Mr. Tibbies on the case! But we haven’t got time to 
stand around! Hurry, now, we’ve got to get you back! 
Oh, the trouble this is going to cause! I will kill him!” 

“But — ” 

The revelation that his batty old cat-obsessed 
neighbor knew what dementors were was almost as 
big a shock to Harry as meeting two of them down the 
alleyway. “You’re — you’re a witch?” 

“I’m a Squib, as Mundungus knows full well, so how 
on earth was I supposed to help you fight off 
dementors? He left you completely without cover 
when I warned him — ” 



Page | 26 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 



“This bloke Mundungus has been following me? Hang 
on — it was him). He Disapparated from the front of 
my house!” 

“Yes, yes, yes, but luckily I’d stationed Mr. Tibbies 
under a car just in case, and Mr. Tibbies came and 
warned me, but by the time I got to your house you’d 
gone — and now — oh, what’s Dumbledore going to 
say? You!” she shrieked at Dudley, still supine on the 
alley floor. “Get your fat bottom off the ground, 
quick!” 

“You know Dumbledore?” said Harry, staring at her. 

“Of course I know Dumbledore, who doesn’t know 
Dumbledore? But come on — I’ll be no help if they 
come back, I’ve never so much as Transfigured a 
teabag — ” 

She stooped down, seized one of Dudley’s massive 
arms in her wizened hands, and tugged. 

“Get up, you useless lump, get up!” 

But Dudley either could not or would not move. He 
was still on the ground, trembling and ashen-faced, 
his mouth shut very tight. 

“I’ll do it.” Harry took hold of Dudley’s arm and 
heaved: With an enormous effort he managed to hoist 
Dudley to his feet. Dudley seemed to be on the point 
of fainting: His small eyes were rolling in their sockets 
and sweat was beading his face; the moment Harry let 
go of him he swayed dangerously. 

“Hurry up!” said Mrs. Figg hysterically. 

Harry pulled one of Dudley’s massive arms around 
his own shoulders and dragged him toward the road, 

Page | 27 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




sagging slightly under his weight. Mrs. Figg tottered 
along in front of them, peering anxiously around the 
corner. 

“Keep your wand out,” she told Harry, as they entered 
Wisteria Walk. “Never mind the Statute of Secrecy 
now, there’s going to be hell to pay anyway, we might 
as well be hanged for a dragon as an egg. Talk about 
the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery ... 
This was exactly what Dumbledore was afraid of — 
what’s that at the end of the street? Oh, it’s just Mr. 
Prentice... Don’t put your wand away, boy, don’t I 
keep telling you I’m no use?” 

It was not easy to hold a wand steady and carry 
Dudley along at the same time. Harry gave his cousin 
an impatient dig in the ribs, but Dudley seemed to 
have lost all desire for independent movement. He 
was slumped on Harry’s shoulder, his large feet 
dragging along the ground. 

“Why didn’t you tell me you’re a Squib?” Harry asked 
Mrs. Figg, panting with the effort to keep walking. “All 
those times I came round your house — why didn’t 
you say anything?” 

“Dumbledore ’s orders. I was to keep an eye on you 
but not say anything, you were too young. I’m sorry I 
gave you such a miserable time, but the Dursleys 
would never have let you come if they’d thought you 
enjoyed it. It wasn’t easy, you know... But oh my 
word,” she said tragically, wringing her hands once 
more, “when Dumbledore hears about this — how 
could Mundungus have left, he was supposed to be 
on duty until midnight — where is he? How am I 
going to tell Dumbledore what’s happened, I can’t 
Apparate — ” 



Page | 28 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“I’ve got an owl, you can borrow her,” Harry groaned, 
wondering whether his spine was going to snap under 
Dudley’s weight. 

“Harry, you don’t understand! Dumbledore will need 
to act as quickly as possible, the Ministry have their 
own ways of detecting underage magic, they’ll know 
already, you mark my words — ” 

“But I was getting rid of dementors, I had to use 
magic — they’re going to be more worried what 
dementors were doing floating around Wisteria Walk, 
surely?” 

“Oh my dear, I wish it were so but I’m afraid — 
MUNDUNGUS FLETCHER, I AM GOING TO KILL 
YOU!” 

There was a loud crack and a strong smell of mingled 
drink and stale tobacco filled the air as a squat, 
unshaven man in a tattered overcoat materialized 
right in front of them. He had short bandy legs, long 
straggly ginger hair, and bloodshot baggy eyes that 
gave him the doleful look of a basset hound; he was 
also clutching a silvery bundle that Harry recognized 
at once as an Invisibility Cloak. 

“ ’S’ up, Figgy?” he said, staring from Mrs. Figg to 
Harry and Dudley. “What ’appened to staying 
undercover?” 

“I’ll give you undercover!” cried Mrs. Figg. “Dementors, 
you useless, skiving sneak thief!” 

“Dementors?” repeated Mundungus, aghast. 
“Dementors here?” 



Page | 29 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Yes, here, you worthless pile of bat droppings, here!” 
shrieked Mrs. Figg. “Dementors attacking the boy on 
your watch!” 

“Blimey,” said Mundungus weakly, looking from Mrs. 
Figg to Harry and back again. “Blimey, I ...” 

“And you off buying stolen cauldrons! Didn’t I tell you 
not to go? Didn’t i?” 

“I — well, I — ” Mundungus looked deeply 
uncomfortable. “It ... it was a very good business 
opportunity, see ...” 

Mrs. Figg raised the arm from which her string bag 
dangled and whacked Mundungus around the face 
and neck with it; judging by the clanking noise it 
made it was full of cat food. 

“Ouch — gerroff — gerroff, you mad old bat! 

Someone’s gotta tell Dumbledore!” 

“Yes — they — have!” yelled Mrs. Figg, still swinging 
the bag of cat food at every bit of Mundungus she 
could reach. “And — it — had — better — be — you — 
and — you — can — tell — him — why — you — 
weren’t — there — to — help!” 

“Keep your ’airnet on!” said Mundungus, his arms 
over his head, cowering. “I’m going, I’m going!” 

And with another loud crack, he vanished. 

“I hope Dumbledore murders him!” said Mrs. Figg 
furiously. “Now come on, Harry, what are you waiting 
for?” 

Harry decided not to waste his remaining breath on 
pointing out that he could barely walk under Dudley’s 

Page | 30 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




bulk. He gave the semiconscious Dudley a heave and 
staggered onward. 

“I’ll take you to the door,” said Mrs. Figg, as they 
turned into Privet Drive. “Just in case there are more 
of them around... Oh my word, what a catastrophe ... 
and you had to fight them off yourself . . . and 
Dumbledore said we were to keep you from doing 
magic at all costs... Well, it’s no good crying over 
spilled potion, I suppose ... but the cat’s among the 
pixies now ...” 

“So,” Harry panted, “Dumbledore ’s ... been having ... 
me followed?” 

“Of course he has,” said Mrs. Figg impatiently. “Did 
you expect him to let you wander around on your own 
after what happened in June? Good Lord, boy, they 
told me you were intelligent... Right ... get inside and 
stay there,” she said as they reached number four. “I 
expect someone will be in touch with you soon 
enough.” 

“What are you going to do?” asked Harry quickly. 

“I’m going straight home,” said Mrs. Figg, staring 
around the dark street and shuddering. “I’ll need to 
wait for more instructions. Just stay in the house. 
Good night.” 

“Hang on, don’t go yet! I want to know — ” 

But Mrs. Figg had already set off at a trot, carpet 
slippers flopping, string bag clanking. 

“Wait!” Harry shouted after her; he had a million 
questions to ask anyone who was in contact with 
Dumbledore; but within seconds Mrs. Figg was 
swallowed by the darkness. Scowling, Harry 

Page | 31 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




readjusted Dudley on his shoulder and made his 
slow, painful way up number four’s garden path. 

The hall light was on. Harry stuck his wand back 
inside the waistband of his jeans, rang the bell, and 
watched Aunt Petunia’s outline grow larger and 
larger, oddly distorted by the rippling glass in the 
front door. 

“Diddy! About time too, I was getting quite — quite — 
Diddy, what’s the matter?” 

Harry looked sideways at Dudley and ducked out 
from under his arm just in time. Dudley swayed for a 
moment on the spot, his face pale green, then he 
opened his mouth at last and vomited all over the 
doormat. 

“DIDDY! Diddy, what’s the matter with you? Vernon? 
VERNON!” 

Harry’s uncle came galumphing out of the living 
room, walrus mustache blowing hither and thither as 
it always did when he was agitated. He hurried 
forward to help Aunt Petunia negotiate a weak-kneed 
Dudley over the threshold while avoiding stepping in 
the pool of sick. 

“He’s ill, Vernon!” 

“What is it, son? What’s happened? Did Mrs. Polkiss 
give you something foreign for tea?” 

“Why are you all covered in dirt, darling? Have you 
been lying on the ground?” 

“Hang on — you haven’t been mugged, have you, 
son?” 



Page | 32 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Aunt Petunia screamed. 



“Phone the police, Vernon! Phone the police! Diddy, 
darling, speak to Mummy! What did they do to you?” 

In all the kerfuffle, nobody seemed to have noticed 
Harry, which suited him perfectly. He managed to slip 
inside just before Uncle Vernon slammed the door 
and while the Dursleys made their noisy progress 
down the hall toward the kitchen, Harry moved 
carefully and quietly toward the stairs. 

“Who did it, son? Give us names. Well get them, don’t 
worry.” 

“Shh! He’s trying to say something, Vernon! What is 
it, Diddy? Tell Mummy!” 

Harry’s foot was on the bottommost stair when 
Dudley found his voice. 

“Him” 

Harry froze, foot on the stair, face screwed up, braced 
for the explosion. 

“BOY! COME HERE!” 

With a feeling of mingled dread and anger, Harry 
removed his foot slowly from the stair and turned to 
follow the Dursleys. 

The scrupulously clean kitchen had an oddly unreal 
glitter after the darkness outside. Aunt Petunia was 
ushering Dudley into a chair; he was still very green 
and clammy looking. Uncle Vernon was standing in 
front of the draining board, glaring at Harry through 
tiny, narrowed eyes. 



Page | 33 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“What have you done to my son?” he said in a 
menacing growl. 



“Nothing,” said Harry, knowing perfectly well that 
Uncle Vernon wouldn’t believe him. 

“What did he do to you, Diddy?” Aunt Petunia said in 
a quavering voice, now sponging sick from the front of 
Dudley’s leather jacket. “Was it — was it you-know- 
what, darling? Did he use — his thing?” 

Slowly, tremulously, Dudley nodded. 

“I didn’t!” Harry said sharply, as Aunt Petunia let out 
a wail and Uncle Vernon raised his fists. “I didn’t do 
anything to him, it wasn’t me, it was — ” 

But at that precise moment a screech owl swooped in 
through the kitchen window. Narrowly missing the 
top of Uncle Vernon’s head, it soared across the 
kitchen, dropped the large parchment envelope it was 
carrying in its beak at Harry’s feet, and turned 
gracefully, the tips of its wings just brushing the top 
of the fridge, then zoomed outside again and off 
across the garden. 

“OWLS!” bellowed Uncle Vernon, the well-worn vein in 
his temple pulsing angrily as he slammed the kitchen 
window shut. “OWLS AGAIN! I WILL NOT HAVE ANY 
MORE OWLS IN MY HOUSE!” 

But Harry was already ripping open the envelope and 
pulling out the letter inside, his heart pounding 
somewhere in the region of his Adam’s apple. 

Dear Mr. Potter, 

We have received intelligence that you performed the 
Patronus Charm at twenty-three minutes past nine this 

Page | 34 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




evening in a Muggle-inhabited area and in the 
presence of a Muggle. 

The severity of this breach of the Decree for the 
Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery has 
resulted in your expulsion from Hog warts School of 
Witchcraft and Wizardry. Ministry representatives will 
be calling at your place of residence shortly to destroy 
your wand. 

As you have already received an official warning for a 
previous offense under section 13 of the International 
Confederation of Wizards’ Statute of Secrecy, we regret 
to inform you that your presence is required at a 
disciplinary hearing at the Ministry of Magic at 9 a. m. 
on August 12th. 

Hoping you are well, 

Yours sincerely, 

Mafalda Hopkirk 

IMPROPER USE OF MAGIC OFFICE 
Ministry of Magic 

Harry read the letter through twice. He was only 
vaguely aware of Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia 
talking in the vicinity. Inside his head, all was icy and 
numb. One fact had penetrated his consciousness 
like a paralyzing dart. He was expelled from 
Hogwarts. It was all over. He was never going back. 

He looked up at the Dursleys. Uncle Vernon was 
purple-faced, shouting, his fists still raised; Aunt 
Petunia had her arms around Dudley, who was 
retching again. 



Page | 35 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Harry’s temporarily stupefied brain seemed to 
reawaken. Ministry representatives will be calling at 
your place of residence shortly to destroy your wand. 
There was only one thing for it. He would have to run 
— now. Where he was going to go, Harry didn’t know, 
but he was certain of one thing: At Hogwarts or 
outside it, he needed his wand. In an almost 
dreamlike state, he pulled his wand out and turned to 
leave the kitchen. 

“Where d’you think you’re going?” yelled Uncle 
Vernon. When Harry didn’t reply, he pounded across 
the kitchen to block the doorway into the hall. “I 
haven’t finished with you, boy!” 

“Get out of the way,” said Harry quietly. 

“You’re going to stay here and explain how my son — ” 

“If you don’t get out of the way I’m going to jinx you,” 
said Harry, raising the wand. 

“You can’t pull that one on me!” snarled Uncle 
Vernon. “I know you’re not allowed to use it outside 
that madhouse you call a school!” 

“The madhouse has chucked me out,” said Harry. “So 
I can do whatever I like. You’ve got three seconds. 

One — two — ” 

A resounding CRACK filled the kitchen; Aunt Petunia 
screamed, Uncle Vernon yelled and ducked, but for 
the third time that night Harry was staring for the 
source of a disturbance he had not made. He spotted 
it at once: A dazed and ruffled-looking barn owl was 
sitting outside on the kitchen sill, having just collided 
with the closed window. 



Page | 36 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Ignoring Uncle Vernon’s anguished yell of “OWLS!” 
Harry crossed the room at a run and wrenched the 
window open again. The owl stuck out its leg, to 
which a small roll of parchment was tied, shook its 
feathers, and took off the moment Harry had pulled 
off the letter. Hands shaking, Harry unfurled the 
second message, which was written very hastily and 
blotchily in black ink. 

Harry — 

Dumbledore’s just arrived at the Ministry, and he’s 
trying to sort it all out. DO NOT LEAVE YOUR AUNT 
AND UNCLE’S HOUSE. DO NOT DO ANYMORE 
MAGIC. DO NOT SURRENDER YOUR WAND. 

Arthur Weasley 

Dumbledore was trying to sort it all out... What did 
that mean? How much power did Dumbledore have to 
override the Ministry of Magic? Was there a chance 
that he might be allowed back to Hogwarts, then? A 
small shoot of hope burgeoned in Harry’s chest, 
almost immediately strangled by panic — how was he 
supposed to refuse to surrender his wand without 
doing magic? He’d have to duel with the Ministry 
representatives, and if he did that, he’d be lucky to 
escape Azkaban, let alone expulsion. 

His mind was racing. . . He could run for it and risk 
being captured by the Ministry, or stay put and wait 
for them to find him here. He was much more 
tempted by the former course, but he knew that Mr. 
Weasley had his best interests at heart ... and, after 
all, Dumbledore had sorted out much worse than this 
before... 

“Right,” Harry said, “I’ve changed my mind, I’m 
staying.” 

Page | 37 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




He flung himself down at the kitchen table and faced 
Dudley and Aunt Petunia. The Dursleys appeared 
taken aback at his abrupt change of mind. Aunt 
Petunia glanced despairingly at Uncle Vernon. The 
vein in Uncle Vernon’s purple temple was throbbing 
worse than ever. 

“Who are all these ruddy owls from?” he growled. 

“The first one was from the Ministry of Magic, 
expelling me,” said Harry calmly; he was straining his 
ears to catch noises outside in case the Ministry 
representatives were approaching, and it was easier 
and quieter to answer Uncle Vernon’s questions than 
to have him start raging and bellowing. “The second 
one was from my friend Ron’s dad, he works at the 
Ministry.” 

“Ministry of Magic?” bellowed Uncle Vernon. “People 
like you in government? Oh this explains everything, 
everything, no wonder the country’s going to the 
dogs...” 

When Harry did not respond, Uncle Vernon glared at 
him, then spat, “And why have you been expelled?” 

“Because I did magic.” 

“AHA!” roared Uncle Vernon, slamming his fist down 
on the top of the fridge, which sprang open; several of 
Dudley’s low-fat snacks toppled out and burst on the 
floor. “So you admit it! What did you do to Dudley?” 

“Nothing,” said Harry, slightly less calmly. “That 
wasn’t me — ” 

“Was,” muttered Dudley unexpectedly, and Uncle 
Vernon and Aunt Petunia instantly made flapping 



Page | 38 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




gestures at Harry to quiet him while they both bent 
low over Dudley. 

“Go on, son,” said Uncle Vernon, “what did he do?” 

“Tell us, darling,” whispered Aunt Petunia. 

“Pointed his wand at me,” Dudley mumbled. 

“Yeah, I did, but I didn’t use — ” Harry began angrily, 
but ... 

“SHUT UP!” roared Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia in 
unison. “Go on, son,” repeated Uncle Vernon, 
mustache blowing about furiously. 

“All dark,” Dudley said hoarsely, shuddering. 
“Everything dark. And then I h-heard . . . things. Inside 
m-my head ...” 

Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia exchanged looks of 
utter horror. If their least favorite thing in the world 
was magic, closely followed by neighbors who cheated 
more than they did on the hosepipe ban, people who 
heard voices were definitely in the bottom ten. They 
obviously thought Dudley was losing his mind. 

“What sort of things did you hear, popkin?” breathed 
Aunt Petunia, very white-faced and with tears in her 
eyes. 

But Dudley seemed incapable of saying. He 
shuddered again and shook his large blond head, and 
despite the sense of numb dread that had settled on 
Harry since the arrival of the first owl, he felt a 
certain curiosity. Dementors caused a person to relive 
the worst moments of their life... What would spoiled, 
pampered, bullying Dudley have been forced to hear? 



Page | 39 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“How come you fell over, son?” said Uncle Vernon in 
an unnaturally quiet voice, the kind of voice he would 
adopt at the bedside of a very ill person. 

“T-tripped,” said Dudley shakily. “And then — ” 

He gestured at his massive chest. Harry understood: 
Dudley was remembering the clammy cold that filled 
the lungs as hope and happiness were sucked out of 
you. 

“Horrible,” croaked Dudley. “Cold. Really cold.” 

“Okay,” said Uncle Vernon in a voice of forced calm, 
while Aunt Petunia laid an anxious hand on Dudley’s 
forehead to feel his temperature. “What happened 
then, Dudders?” 

“Felt ... felt ... felt ... as if... as if ...” 

“As if you’d never be happy again,” Harry supplied 
tonelessly. 

“Yes,” Dudley whispered, still trembling. 

“So,” said Uncle Vernon, voice restored to full and 
considerable volume as he straightened up. “So you 
put some crackpot spell on my son so he’d hear 
voices and believe he was — was doomed to misery, 
or something, did you?” 

“How many times do I have to tell you?” said Harry, 
temper and voice rising together. “It wasn’t me\ It was 
a couple of dementors!” 

“A couple of — what’s this codswallop?” 

“De — men — tors,” said Harry slowly and clearly. 
“Two of them.” 

Page | 40 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




“And what the ruddy hell are dementors?” 



“They guard the wizard prison, Azkaban,” said Aunt 
Petunia. 

Two seconds’ ringing silence followed these words and 
then Aunt Petunia clapped her hand over her mouth 
as though she had let slip a disgusting swear word. 
Uncle Vernon was goggling at her. Harry’s brain 
reeled. Mrs. Figg was one thing — but Aunt Petunia? 

“How d’you know that?” he asked her, astonished. 

Aunt Petunia looked quite appalled with herself. She 
glanced at Uncle Vernon in fearful apology, then 
lowered her hand slightly to reveal her horsey teeth. 

“I heard — that awful boy — telling her about them — 
years ago,” she said jerkily. 

“If you mean my mum and dad, why don’t you use 
their names?” said Harry loudly, but Aunt Petunia 
ignored him. She seemed horribly flustered. 

Harry was stunned. Except for one outburst years 
ago, in the course of which Aunt Petunia had 
screamed that Harry’s mother had been a freak, he 
had never heard her mention her sister. He was 
astounded that she had remembered this scrap of 
information about the magical world for so long, when 
she usually put all her energies into pretending it 
didn’t exist. 

Uncle Vernon opened his mouth, closed it again, 
opened it once more, shut it, then, apparently 
struggling to remember how to talk, opened it for a 
third time and croaked, “So — so — they — er — they 
— er — they actually exist, do they — er — dementy- 
whatsits?” 

Page | 41 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




Aunt Petunia nodded. 



Uncle Vernon looked from Aunt Petunia to Dudley to 
Harry as if hoping somebody was going to shout 
“April Fool!” When nobody did, he opened his mouth 
yet again, but was spared the struggle to find more 
words by the arrival of the third owl of the evening, 
which zoomed through the still-open window like a 
feathery cannonball and landed with a clatter on the 
kitchen table, causing all three of the Dursleys to 
jump with fright. Harry tore a second official-looking 
envelope from the owl’s beak and ripped it open as 
the owl swooped back out into the night. 

“Enough — effing — owls ...” muttered Uncle Vernon 
distractedly, stomping over to the window and 
slamming it shut again. 

Dear Mr. Potter, 

Further to our letter of approximately twenty-two 
minutes ago, the Ministry of Magic has revised its 
decision to destroy your wand forthwith. You may 
retain your wand until your disciplinary hearing on 
12th August, at which time an official decision will be 
taken. 

Following discussions with the Headmaster of 
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the 
Ministry has agreed that the question of your expulsion 
will also be decided at that time. You should therefore 
consider yourself suspended from school pending 
further inquiries. 

With best wishes, 

Yours sincerely, 

Mafalda Hopkirk

IMPROPER USE OF MAGIC OFFICE 



Ministry of Magic 

Harry read this letter through three times in quick 
succession. The miserable knot in his chest loosened 
slightly at the thought that he was not definitely 
expelled, though his fears were by no means 
banished. Everything seemed to hang on this hearing 
on the twelfth of August. 

“Well?” said Uncle Vernon, recalling Harry to his 
surroundings. “What now? Have they sentenced you 
to anything? Do your lot have the death penalty?” he 
added as a hopeful afterthought. 

“I’ve got to go to a hearing,” said Harry. 

“And they’ll sentence you there?” 

“I suppose so.” 

“I won’t give up hope, then,” said Uncle Vernon 
nastily. 

“Well, if that’s all,” said Harry, getting to his feet. He 
was desperate to be alone, to think, perhaps to send a 
letter to Ron, Hermione, or Sirius. 

“NO, IT RUDDY WELL IS NOT ALL!” bellowed Uncle 
Vernon. “SIT BACK DOWN!” 

“What now?” said Harry impatiently. 

“DUDLEY!” roared Uncle Vernon. “I want to know 
exactly what happened to my son!” 

“FINE!” yelled Harry, and in his temper, red and gold 
sparks shot out of the end of his wand, still clutched 

Page | 43 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




in his hand. All three Dursleys flinched, looking 
terrified. 

“Dudley and I were in the alleyway between Magnolia 
Crescent and Wisteria Walk,” said Harry, speaking 
fast, fighting to control his temper. “Dudley thought 
he’d be smart with me, I pulled out my wand but 
didn’t use it. Then two dementors turned up — ” 

“But what ARE dementoids?” asked Uncle Vernon 
furiously. “What do they DO?” 

“I told you — they suck all the happiness out of you,” 
said Harry, “and if they get the chance, they kiss you 



“Kiss you?” said Uncle Vernon, his eyes popping 
slightly. “Kiss you?” 

“It’s what they call it when they suck the soul out of 
your mouth.” 

Aunt Petunia uttered a soft scream. 

“His soul? They didn’t take — he’s still got his — ” 

She seized Dudley by the shoulders and shook him, 
as though testing to see whether she could hear his 
soul rattling around inside him. 

“Of course they didn’t get his soul, you’d know if they 
had,” said Harry, exasperated. 

“Fought ’em off, did you, son?” said Uncle Vernon 
loudly, with the appearance of a man struggling to 
bring the conversation back onto a plane he 
understood. “Gave ’em the old one-two, did you?” 



Page | 44 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




“You can’t give a dementor the old one-two,” said 
Harry through clenched teeth. 

“Why’s he all right, then?” blustered Uncle Vernon. 
“Why isn’t he all empty, then?” 

“Because I used the Patronus — ” 

WHOOSH. With a clattering, a whirring of wings, and 
a soft fall of dust, a fourth owl came shooting out of 
the kitchen fireplace. 

“FOR GOD’S SAKE!” roared Uncle Vernon, pulling 
great clumps of hair out of his mustache, something 
he hadn’t been driven to in a long time. “I WILL NOT 
HAVE OWLS HERE, I WILL NOT TOLERATE THIS, I 
TELL YOU!” 

But Harry was already pulling a roll of parchment 
from the owl’s leg. He was so convinced that this 
letter had to be from Dumbledore, explaining 
everything — the dementors, Mrs. Figg, what the 
Ministry was up to, how he, Dumbledore, intended to 
sort everything out — that for the first time in his life 
he was disappointed to see Sirius’s handwriting. 
Ignoring Uncle Vernon’s ongoing rant about owls and 
narrowing his eyes against a second cloud of dust as 
the most recent owl took off back up the chimney, 
Harry read Sirius’s message. 

Arthur’s just told us what’s happened. 

Don’t leave the house again, whatever you do. 

Harry found this such an inadequate response to 
everything that had happened tonight that he turned 
the piece of parchment over, looking for the rest of the 
letter, but there was nothing there. 



Page | 45 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




And now his temper was rising again. Wasn’t 
anybody going to say “well done” for fighting off two 
dementors single-handedly? Both Mr. Weasley and 
Sirius were acting as though he’d misbehaved and 
they were saving their tellings-off until they could 
ascertain how much damage had been done. 

“ — a peck, I mean, pack of owls shooting in and out 
of my house and I won’t have it, boy, I won’t — ” 

“I can’t stop the owls coming,” Harry snapped, 
crushing Sirius’s letter in his fist. 

“I want the truth about what happened tonight!” 
barked Uncle Vernon. “If it was demenders who hurt 
Dudley, how come you’ve been expelled? You did you- 
know-what, you’ve admitted it!” 

Harry took a deep, steadying breath. His head was 
beginning to ache again. He wanted more than 
anything to get out of the kitchen, away from the 
Dursleys. 

“I did the Patronus Charm to get rid of the 
dementors,” he said, forcing himself to remain calm. 
“It’s the only thing that works against them.” 

“But what were dementoids doing in Little Whinging?” 
said Uncle Vernon in tones of outrage. 

“Couldn’t tell you,” said Harry wearily. “No idea.” 

His head was pounding in the glare of the strip 
lighting now. His anger was ebbing away. He felt 
drained, exhausted. The Dursleys were all staring at 
him. 

“It’s you,” said Uncle Vernon forcefully. “It’s got 
something to do with you, boy, I know it. Why else 

Page | 46 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




would they turn up here? Why else would they be 
down that alleyway? You’ve got to be the only — the 
only — ” Evidently he couldn’t bring himself to say the 
word “wizard.” “The only you-know-what for miles.” 

“I don’t know why they were here...” 

But at these words of Uncle Vernon’s, Harry’s 
exhausted brain ground back into action. Why had 
the dementors come to Little Whinging? How could it 
be coincidence that they had arrived in the alleyway 
where Harry was? Had they been sent? Had the 
Ministry of Magic lost control of the dementors, had 
they deserted Azkaban and joined Voldemort, as 
Dumbledore had predicted they would? 

“These demembers guard some weirdos’ prison?” said 
Uncle Vernon, lumbering in the wake of Harry’s train 
of thought. 

“Yes,” said Harry. 

If only his head would stop hurting, if only he could 
just leave the kitchen and get to his dark bedroom 
and think... 

“Oho! They were coming to arrest you!” said Uncle 
Vernon, with the triumphant air of a man reaching an 
unassailable conclusion. “That’s it, isn’t it, boy? 

You’re on the run from the law!” 

“Of course I’m not,” said Harry, shaking his head as 
though to scare off a fly, his mind racing now. 

“Then why — ?” 

“He must have sent them,” said Harry quietly, more to 
himself than to Uncle Vernon. 



Page | 47 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




“What’s that? Who must have sent them?” 

“Lord Voldemort,” said Harry. 

He registered dimly how strange it was that the 
Dursleys, who flinched, winced, and squawked if they 
heard words like “wizard,” “magic,” or “wand,” could 
hear the name of the most evil wizard of all time 
without the slightest tremor. 

“Lord — hang on,” said Uncle Vernon, his face 
screwed up, a look of dawning comprehension in his 
piggy eyes. “I’ve heard that name ... that was the one 
who ...” 

“Murdered my parents, yes,” Harry said. 

“But he’s gone,” said Uncle Vernon impatiently, 
without the slightest sign that the murder of Harry’s 
parents might be a painful topic to anybody. “That 
giant bloke said so. He’s gone.” 

“He’s back,” said Harry heavily. 

It felt very strange to be standing here in Aunt 
Petunia’s surgically clean kitchen, beside the top-of- 
the-range fridge and the wide-screen television, and 
talking calmly of Lord Voldemort to Uncle Vernon. 

The arrival of the dementors in Little Whinging 
seemed to have caused a breach in the great, invisible 
wall that divided the relentlessly non-magical world of 
Privet Drive and the world beyond. Harry’s two lives 
had somehow become fused and everything had been 
turned upside down: The Dursleys were asking for 
details about the magical world and Mrs. Figg knew 
Albus Dumbledore; dementors were soaring around 
Little Whinging and he might never go back to 
Hogwarts. Harry’s head throbbed more painfully. 



Page | 48 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




“Back?” whispered Aunt Petunia. 

She was looking at Harry as she had never looked at 
him before. And all of a sudden, for the very first time 
in his life, Harry fully appreciated that Aunt Petunia 
was his mother’s sister. He could not have said why 
this hit him so very powerfully at this moment. All he 
knew was that he was not the only person in the 
room who had an inkling of what Lord Voldemort 
being back might mean. Aunt Petunia had never in 
her life looked at him like that before. Her large, pale 
eyes (so unlike her sister’s) were not narrowed in 
dislike or anger: They were wide and fearful. The 
furious pretense that Aunt Petunia had maintained 
all Harry’s life — that there was no magic and no 
world other than the world she inhabited with Uncle 
Vernon — seemed to have fallen away. 

“Yes,” Harry said, talking directly to Aunt Petunia 
now. “He came back a month ago. I saw him.” 

Her hands found Dudley’s massive leather-clad 
shoulders and clutched them. 

“Hang on,” said Uncle Vernon, looking from his wife 
to Harry and back again, apparently dazed and 
confused by the unprecedented understanding that 
seemed to have sprung up between them. “Hang on. 
This Lord Voldything’s back, you say.” 

“Yes.” 

“The one who murdered your parents.” 

“Yes.” 

“And now he’s sending dismembers after you?” 

“Looks like it,” said Harry. 

Page | 49 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




“I see,” said Uncle Vernon, looking from his white- 
faced wife to Harry and hitching up his trousers. He 
seemed to be swelling, his great purple face stretching 
before Harry’s eyes. “Well, that settles it,” he said, his 
shirt front straining as he inflated himself, “you can 
get out of this house, boy\” 

“What?” said Harry. 

“You heard me — OUT!” Uncle Vernon bellowed, and 
even Aunt Petunia and Dudley jumped. “OUT! OUT! I 
should’ve done it years ago! Owls treating the place 
like a rest home, puddings exploding, half the lounge 
destroyed, Dudley’s tail, Marge bobbing around on 
the ceiling, and that flying Ford Anglia — OUT! OUT! 
You’ve had it! You’re history! You’re not staying here if 
some loony’s after you, you’re not endangering my 
wife and son, you’re not bringing trouble down on us, 
if you’re going the same way as your useless parents, 
I’ve had it! OUT!” 

Harry stood rooted to the spot. The letters from the 
Ministry, Mr. Weasley, and Sirius were crushed in his 
left hand. Don’t leave the house again, whatever you 
do. DO NOT LEA VE YOUR A UNT AND UNCLE’S 
HOUSE. 

“You heard me!” said Uncle Vernon, bending forward 
now, so that his massive purple face came closer to 
Harry’s, so that Harry actually felt flecks of spit hit 
his face. “Get going! You were all keen to leave half an 
hour ago! I’m right behind you! Get out and never 
darken our doorstep again! Why we ever kept you in 
the first place I don’t know. Marge was right, it should 
have been the orphanage, we were too damn soft for 
our own good, thought we could squash it out of you, 
thought we could turn you normal, but you’ve been 
rotten from the beginning, and I’ve had enough — 
OWLS!” 

Page | 50 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




The fifth owl zoomed down the chimney so fast it 
actually hit the floor before zooming into the air again 
with a loud screech. Harry raised his hand to seize 
the letter, which was in a scarlet envelope, but it 
soared straight over his head, flying directly at Aunt 
Petunia, who let out a scream and ducked, her arms 
over her face. The owl dropped the red envelope on 
her head, turned, and flew straight up the chimney 
again. 

Harry darted forward to pick up the letter, but Aunt 
Petunia beat him to it. 

“You can open it if you like,” said Harry, “but I’ll hear 
what it says anyway. That’s a Howler.” 

“Let go of it, Petunia!” roared Uncle Vernon. “Don’t 
touch it, it could be dangerous!” 

“It’s addressed to me,” said Aunt Petunia in a shaking 
voice. “It’s addressed to me, Vernon, look! Mrs. 

Petunia Dursley, The Kitchen, Number Four, Privet 
Drive — ” 

She caught her breath, horrified. The red envelope 
had begun to smoke. 

“Open it!” Harry urged her. “Get it over with! It’ll 
happen anyway — ” 

“No — ” 



Aunt Petunia’s hand was trembling. She looked wildly 
around the kitchen as though looking for an escape 
route, but too late — the envelope burst into flames. 
Aunt Petunia screamed and dropped it. 



Page | 51 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




An awful voice filled the kitchen, echoing in the 
confined space, issuing from the burning letter on the 
table. 



“REMEMBER MY LAST, PETUNIA.” 

Aunt Petunia looked as though she might faint. She 
sank into the chair beside Dudley, her face in her 
hands. The remains of the envelope smoldered into 
ash in the silence. 

“What is this?” Uncle Vernon said hoarsely. “What — 

I don’t — Petunia?” 

Aunt Petunia said nothing. Dudley was staring 
stupidly at his mother, his mouth hanging open. The 
silence spiraled horribly. Harry was watching his 
aunt, utterly bewildered, his head throbbing fit to 
burst. 

“Petunia, dear?” said Uncle Vernon timidly. “P- 
Petunia?” 

She raised her head. She was still trembling. She 
swallowed. 

“The boy — the boy will have to stay, Vernon,” she 
said weakly. 

“W-what?” 

“He stays,” she said. She was not looking at Harry. 

She got to her feet again. 

“He ... but Petunia ...” 

“If we throw him out, the neighbors will talk,” she 
said. She was regaining her usual brisk, snappish 
manner rapidly, though she was still very pale. 

Page | 52 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




“They’ll ask awkward questions, they’ll want to know 
where he’s gone. We’ll have to keep him.” 

Uncle Vernon was deflating like an old tire. 

“But Petunia, dear — ” 

Aunt Petunia ignored him. She turned to Harry. 

“You’re to stay in your room,” she said. “You’re not to 
leave the house. Now get to bed.” 

Harry didn’t move. 

“Who was that Howler from?” 

“Don’t ask questions,” Aunt Petunia snapped. 

“Are you in touch with wizards?” 

“I told you to get to bed!” 

“What did it mean? Remember the last what?” 

“Go to bed!” 

“How come — ?” 

“YOU HEARD YOUR AUNT, NOW GET TO BED!” 



Page | 53 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 






THE ADVANCED GUARD 

“Fve just been attacked by dementors and I might be 
expelled from Hogwarts. I want to know what’s going 
on and when I’m going to get out of here. ” 

Harry copied these words onto three separate pieces 
of parchment the moment he reached the desk in his 
dark bedroom. He addressed the first to Sirius, the 
second to Ron, and the third to Hermione. His owl, 
Hedwig, was off hunting; her cage stood empty on the 
desk. Harry paced the bedroom waiting for her to 
come back, his head pounding, his brain too busy for 
sleep even though his eyes stung and itched with 
tiredness. His back ached from carrying Dudley 
home, and the two lumps on his head where the 
window and Dudley had hit him were throbbing 
painfully. 

Up and down he paced, consumed with anger and 
frustration, grinding his teeth and clenching his fists, 
casting angry looks out at the empty, star-strewn sky 
every time he passed the window. Dementors sent to 
get him, Mrs. Figg and Mundungus Fletcher tailing 
Page | 54 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 



him in secret, then suspension from Hogwarts and a 
hearing at the Ministry of Magic — and still no one 
was telling him what was going on. 

And what, what, had that Howler been about? Whose 
voice had echoed so horribly, so menacingly, through 
the kitchen? 

Why was he still trapped here without information? 
Why was everyone treating him like some naughty 
kid? Don’t do any more magic, stay in the house... 

He kicked his school trunk as he passed it, but far 
from relieving his anger he felt worse, as he now had 
a sharp pain in his toe to deal with in addition to the 
pain in the rest of his body. 

Just as he limped past the window, Hedwig soared 
through it with a soft rustle of wings like a small 
ghost. 

“About time!” Harry snarled, as she landed lightly on 
top of her cage. “You can put that down, IVe got work 
for you!” 

Hedwig’s large round amber eyes gazed reproachfully 
at him over the dead frog clamped in her beak. 

“Come here,” said Harry, picking up the three small 
rolls of parchment and a leather thong and tying the 
scrolls to her scaly leg. “Take these straight to Sirius, 
Ron, and Hermione and don’t come back here without 
good long replies. Keep pecking them till they’ve 
written decent-length answers if you’ve got to. 
Understand?” 

Hedwig gave a muffled hooting noise, beak still full of 
frog. 



Page | 55 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Get going, then,” said Harry. 

She took off immediately. The moment she’d gone, 
Harry threw himself down onto his bed without 
undressing and stared at the dark ceiling. In addition 
to every other miserable feeling, he now felt guilty 
that he’d been irritable with Hedwig; she was the only 
friend he had at number four, Privet Drive. But he’d 
make it up to her when she came back with Sirius’s, 
Ron’s, and Hermione’s answers. 

They were bound to write back quickly; they couldn’t 
possibly ignore a dementor attack. He’d probably 
wake up tomorrow to three fat letters full of sympathy 
and plans for his immediate removal to the Burrow. 
And with that comforting idea, sleep rolled over him, 
stifling all further thought. 

•k Jc k 



But Hedwig didn’t return next morning. Harry spent 
the day in his bedroom, leaving it only to go to the 
bathroom. Three times that day Aunt Petunia shoved 
food into his room through the cat flap Uncle Vernon 
had installed three summers ago. Every time Harry 
heard her approaching he tried to question her about 
the Howler, but he might as well have interrogated 
the doorknob for all the answers he got. Otherwise 
the Dursleys kept well clear of his bedroom. Harry 
couldn’t see the point of forcing his company on 
them; another row would achieve nothing except 
perhaps making him so angry he’d perform more 
illegal magic. 

So it went on for three whole days. Harry was filled 
alternately with restless energy that made him unable 
to settle to anything, during which he paced his 
bedroom again, furious at the whole lot of them for 



Page | 56 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




leaving him to stew in this mess, and with a lethargy 
so complete that he could lie on his bed for an hour 
at a time, staring dazedly into space, aching with 
dread at the thought of the Ministry hearing. 

What if they ruled against him? What if he was 
expelled and his wand was snapped in half? What 
would he do, where would he go? He could not return 
to living full-time with the Dursleys, not now that he 
knew the other world, the one to which he really 
belonged... Was it possible that he might be able to 
move into Sirius’s house, as Sirius had suggested a 
year ago, before he had been forced to flee from the 
Ministry himself? Would he be allowed to live there 
alone, given that he was still underage? Or would the 
matter of where he went next be decided for him; had 
his breach of the International Statute of Secrecy 
been severe enough to land him in a cell in Azkaban? 
Whenever this thought occurred, Harry invariably slid 
off his bed and began pacing again. 

On the fourth night after Hedwig’s departure Harry 
was lying in one of his apathetic phases, staring at 
the ceiling, his exhausted mind quite blank, when his 
uncle entered his bedroom. Harry looked slowly 
around at him. Uncle Vernon was wearing his best 
suit and an expression of enormous smugness. 

“We’re going out,” he said. 

“Sorry?” 

“We — that is to say, your aunt, Dudley, and I — are 
going out.” 

“Fine,” said Harry dully, looking back at the ceiling. 

“You are not to leave your bedroom while we are 
away.” 

Page | 57 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




“Okay.” 



“You are not to touch the television, the stereo, or any 
of our possessions.” 

“Right.” 

“You are not to steal food from the fridge.” 

“Okay.” 

“I am going to lock your door.” 

“You do that.” 

Uncle Vernon glared at Harry, clearly suspicious of 
this lack of argument, then stomped out of the room 
and closed the door behind him. Harry heard the key 
turn in the lock and Uncle Vernon’s footsteps walking 
heavily down the stairs. A few minutes later he heard 
the slamming of car doors, the rumble of an engine, 
and the unmistakable sound of the car sweeping out 
of the drive. 

Harry had no particular feeling about the Dursleys 
leaving. It made no difference to him whether they 
were in the house or not. He could not even summon 
the energy to get up and turn on his bedroom light. 
The room grew steadily darker around him as he lay 
listening to the night sounds through the window he 
kept open all the time, waiting for the blessed 
moment when Hedwig returned. 

The empty house creaked around him. The pipes 
gurgled. Harry lay there in a kind of stupor, thinking 
of nothing, suspended in misery. 

And then, quite distinctly, he heard a crash in the 
kitchen below. 

Page | 58 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




He sat bolt upright, listening intently. The Dursleys 
couldn’t be back, it was much too soon, and in any 
case he hadn’t heard their car. 

There was silence for a few seconds, and then he 
heard voices. 

Burglars, he thought, sliding off the bed onto his feet 
— but a split second later it occurred to him that 
burglars would keep their voices down, and whoever 
was moving around in the kitchen was certainly not 
troubling to do so. 

He snatched up his wand from his bedside table and 
stood facing his bedroom door, listening with all his 
might. Next moment he jumped as the lock gave a 
loud click and his door swung open. 

Harry stood motionless, staring through the open 
door at the dark upstairs landing, straining his ears 
for further sounds, but none came. He hesitated for a 
moment and then moved swiftly and silently out of 
his room to the head of the stairs. 

His heart shot upward into his throat. There were 
people standing in the shadowy hall below, 
silhouetted against the streetlight glowing through 
the glass door; eight or nine of them, all, as far as he 
could see, looking up at him. 

“Lower your wand, boy, before you take someone’s eye 
out,” said a low, growling voice. 

Harry’s heart was thumping uncontrollably. He knew 
that voice, but he did not lower his wand. 

“Professor Moody?” he said uncertainly. 



Page | 59 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“I don’t know so much about ‘Professor,’ ” growled the 
voice, “never got round to much teaching, did I? Get 
down here, we want to see you properly.” 

Harry lowered his wand slightly but did not relax his 
grip on it, nor did he move. He had very good reason 
to be suspicious. He had recently spent nine months 
in what he had thought was Mad-Eye Moody’s 
company only to find out that it wasn’t Moody at all, 
but an impostor; an impostor, moreover, who had 
tried to kill Harry before being unmasked. But before 
he could make a decision about what to do next, a 
second, slightly hoarse voice floated upstairs. 

“It’s all right, Harry. We’ve come to take you away.” 

Harry’s heart leapt. He knew that voice too, though he 
hadn’t heard it for more than a year. 

“P-Professor Lupin?” he said disbelievingly. “Is that 
you?” 

“Why are we all standing in the dark?” said a third 
voice, this one completely unfamiliar, a woman’s. 
“Lumos.” 

A wand tip flared, illuminating the hall with magical 
light. Harry blinked. The people below were crowded 
around the foot of the stairs, gazing intently up at 
him, some craning their heads for a better look. 

Remus Lupin stood nearest to him. Though still quite 
young, Lupin looked tired and rather ill; he had more 
gray hair than when Harry had said good-bye to him, 
and his robes were more patched and shabbier than 
ever. Nevertheless, he was smiling broadly at Harry, 
who tried to smile back through his shock.

“Oooh, he looks just like I thought he would,” said the 
witch who was holding her lit wand aloft. She looked 
the youngest there; she had a pale heart-shaped face, 
dark twinkling eyes, and short spiky hair that was a 
violent shade of violet. “Wotcher, Harry!” 

“Yeah, I see what you mean, Remus,” said a bald 
black wizard standing farthest back; he had a deep, 
slow voice and wore a single gold hoop in his ear. “He 
looks exactly like James.” 

“Except the eyes,” said a wheezy-voiced, silver-haired 
wizard at the back. “Lily’s eyes.” 

Mad-Eye Moody, who had long grizzled gray hair and 
a large chunk missing from his nose, was squinting 
suspiciously at Harry through his mismatched eyes. 
One of the eyes was small, dark, and beady, the other 
large, round, and electric blue — the magical eye that 
could see through walls, doors, and the back of 
Moody’s own head. 

“Are you quite sure it’s him, Lupin?” he growled. “It’d 
be a nice lookout if we bring back some Death Eater 
impersonating him. We ought to ask him something 
only the real Potter would know. Unless anyone 
brought any Veritaserum?” 

“Harry, what form does your Patronus take?” said 
Lupin. 

“A stag,” said Harry nervously. 

“That’s him, Mad-Eye,” said Lupin. 

Harry descended the stairs, very conscious of 
everybody still staring at him, stowing his wand into 
the back pocket of his jeans as he came. 



Page | 61 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Don’t put your wand there, boy!” roared Moody. 
“What if it ignited? Better wizards than you have lost 
buttocks, you know!” 

“Who d’you know who’s lost a buttock?” the violet- 
haired woman asked Mad-Eye interestedly. 

“Never you mind, you just keep your wand out of your 
back pocket!” growled Mad-Eye. “Elementary wand 
safety, nobody bothers about it anymore...” He 
stumped off toward the kitchen. “And I saw that,” he 
added irritably, as the woman rolled her eyes at the 
ceiling. 

Lupin held out his hand and shook Harry’s. 

“How are you?” he asked, looking at Harry closely. 
“F-fine ...” 

Harry could hardly believe this was real. Four weeks 
with nothing, not the tiniest hint of a plan to remove 
him from Privet Drive, and suddenly a whole bunch of 
wizards was standing matter-of-factly in the house as 
though this were a long-standing arrangement. He 
glanced at the people surrounding Lupin; they were 
still gazing avidly at him. He felt very conscious of the 
fact that he had not combed his hair for four days. 

“I’m — you’re really lucky the Dursleys are out ...” he 
mumbled. 

“Lucky, ha!” said the violet-haired woman. “It was me 
that lured them out of the way. Sent a letter by 
Muggle post telling them they’d been short-listed for 
the All-England Best-Kept Suburban Lawn 
Competition. They’re heading off to the prize-giving 
right now... Or they think they are.” 



Page | 62 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Harry had a fleeting vision of Uncle Vernon’s face 
when he realized there was no All-England Best-Kept 
Suburban Lawn Competition. 

“We are leaving, aren’t we?” he asked. “Soon?” 

“Almost at once,” said Lupin, “we’re just waiting for 
the all-clear.” 

“Where are we going? The Burrow?” Harry asked 
hopefully. 

“Not the Burrow, no,” said Lupin, motioning Harry 
toward the kitchen; the little knot of wizards followed, 
all still eyeing Harry curiously. “Too risky. We’ve set 
up headquarters somewhere undetectable. It’s taken 
a while...” 

Mad-Eye Moody was now sitting at the kitchen table 
swigging from a hip flask, his magical eye spinning in 
all directions, taking in the Dursleys’ many labor- 
saving appliances. 

“This is Alastor Moody, Harry,” Lupin continued, 
pointing toward Moody. 

“Yeah, I know,” said Harry uncomfortably; it felt odd 
to be introduced to somebody he’d thought he’d 
known for a year. 

“And this is Nymphadora — ” 

“ Don’t call me Nymphadora, Remus,” said the young 
witch with a shudder. “It’s Tonks.” 

“ — Nymphadora Tonks, who prefers to be known by 
her surname only,” finished Lupin. 



Page | 63 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“So would you if your fool of a mother had called you 
‘Nymphadora, ’ ” muttered Tonks. 

“And this is Kingsley Shacklebolt” — he indicated the 
tall black wizard, who bowed — “Elphias Doge” — the 
wheezy-voiced wizard nodded — “Dedalus Diggle — ” 

“We’ve met before,” squeaked the excitable Diggle, 
dropping his top hat. 

“ — Emmeline Vance” — a stately looking witch in an 
emerald-green shawl inclined her head — “Sturgis 
Podmore” — a square-jawed wizard with thick, straw- 
colored hair winked — “and Hestia Jones.” A pink- 
cheeked, black-haired witch waved from next to the 
toaster. 

Harry inclined his head awkwardly at each of them as 
they were introduced. He wished they would look at 
something other than him; it was as though he had 
suddenly been ushered onstage. He also wondered 
why so many of them were there. 

“A surprising number of people volunteered to come 
and get you,” said Lupin, as though he had read 
Harry’s mind; the corners of his mouth twitched 
slightly. 

“Yeah, well, the more the better,” said Moody darkly. 
“We’re your guard, Potter.” 

“We’re just waiting for the signal to tell us it’s safe to 
set off,” said Lupin, glancing out of the kitchen 
window. “We’ve got about fifteen minutes.” 

“Very clean, aren’t they, these Muggles?” said the 
witch called Tonks, who was looking around the 
kitchen with great interest. “My dad’s Muggle-born 



Page | 64 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




and he’s a right old slob. I suppose it varies, just like 
with wizards?” 

“Er — yeah,” said Harry. “Look” — he turned back to 
Lupin — “what’s going on, I haven’t heard anything 
from anyone, what’s Vol — ?” 

Several of the witches and wizards made odd hissing 
noises; Dedalus Diggle dropped his hat again, and 
Moody growled, “Shut up\” 

“What?” said Harry. 

“We’re not discussing anything here, it’s too risky,” 
said Moody, turning his normal eye on Harry; his 
magical eye remained pointing up at the ceiling. 
“Damn it,” he added angrily, putting a hand up to the 
magical eye, “it keeps sticking — ever since that scum 
wore it — ” 

And with a nasty squelching sound much like a 
plunger being pulled from a sink, he popped out his 
eye. 

“Mad-Eye, you do know that’s disgusting, don’t you?” 
said Tonks conversationally. 

“Get me a glass of water, would you, Harry?” asked 
Moody. 

Harry crossed to the dishwasher, took out a clean 
glass, and filled it with water at the sink, still watched 
eagerly by the band of wizards. Their relentless 
staring was starting to annoy him. 

“Cheers,” said Moody, when Harry handed him the 
glass. He dropped the magical eyeball into the water 
and prodded it up and down; the eye whizzed around, 



Page | 65 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




staring at them all in turn. “I want three-hundred- 
and-sixty degrees visibility on the return journey.” 

“How’re we getting — wherever we’re going?” Harry 
asked. 

“Brooms,” said Lupin. “Only way. You’re too young to 
Apparate, they’ll be watching the Floo Network, and 
it’s more than our life’s worth to set up an 
unauthorized Portkey.” 

“Remus says you’re a good flier,” said Kingsley 
Shacklebolt in his deep voice. 

“He’s excellent,” said Lupin, who was checking his 
watch. “Anyway, you’d better go and get packed, 
Harry, we want to be ready to go when the signal 
comes.” 

“I’ll come and help you,” said Tonks brightly. 

She followed Harry back into the hall and up the 
stairs, looking around with much curiosity and 
interest. 

“Funny place,” she said, “it’s a bit too clean, d’you 
know what I mean? Bit unnatural. Oh, this is better,” 
she added, as they entered Harry’s bedroom and he 
turned on the light. 

His room was certainly much messier than the rest of 
the house. Confined to it for four days in a very bad 
mood, Harry had not bothered tidying up after 
himself. Most of the books he owned were strewn over 
the floor where he’d tried to distract himself with each 
in turn and thrown it aside. Hedwig’s cage needed 
cleaning out and was starting to smell, and his trunk 
lay open, revealing a jumbled mixture of Muggle 



Page | 66 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




clothes and wizard’s robes that had spilled onto the 
floor around it. 

Harry started picking up books and throwing them 
hastily into his trunk. Tonks paused at his open 
wardrobe to look critically at her reflection in the 
mirror on the inside of the door. 

“You know, I don’t think purple’s really my color,” she 
said pensively, tugging at a lock of spiky hair. “D’you 
think it makes me look a bit peaky?” 

“Er — ” said Harry, looking up at her over the top of 
Quidditch Teams of Britain and Ireland. 

“Yeah, it does,” said Tonks decisively. She screwed up 
her eyes in a strained expression as though she were 
struggling to remember something. A second later, 
her hair had turned bubble-gum pink. 

“How did you do that?” said Harry, gaping at her as 
she opened her eyes again. 

“I’m a Metamorphmagus,” she said, looking back at 
her reflection and turning her head so that she could 
see her hair from all directions. “It means I can 
change my appearance at will,” she added, spotting 
Harry’s puzzled expression in the mirror behind her. 

“I was born one. I got top marks in Concealment and 
Disguise during Auror training without any study at 
all, it was great.” 

“You’re an Auror?” said Harry, impressed. Being a 
Dark wizard catcher was the only career he’d ever 
considered after Hogwarts. 

“Yeah,” said Tonks, looking proud. “Kingsley is as 
well; he’s a bit higher up than I am, though. I only 
qualified a year ago. Nearly failed on Stealth and 

Page | 67 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




Tracking, I’m dead clumsy, did you hear me break 
that plate when we arrived downstairs?” 



“Can you learn how to be a Metamorphmagus?” Harry 
asked her, straightening up, completely forgetting 
about packing. 

Tonks chuckled. 

“Bet you wouldn’t mind hiding that scar sometimes, 
eh?” 

Her eyes found the lightning-shaped scar on Harry’s 
forehead. 

“No, I wouldn’t mind,” Harry mumbled, turning away. 
He did not like people staring at his scar. 

“Well, you 11 have to learn the hard way, I’m afraid,” 
said Tonks. “Metamorphmagi are really rare, they’re 
born, not made. Most wizards need to use a wand or 
potions to change their appearance... But we’ve got to 
get going, Harry, we’re supposed to be packing,” she 
added guiltily, looking around at all the mess on the 
floor. 

“Oh — yeah,” said Harry, grabbing up a few more 
books. 

“Don’t be stupid, it’ll be much quicker if I — pack).” 
cried Tonks, waving her wand in a long, sweeping 
movement over the floor. 

Books, clothes, telescope, and scales all soared into 
the air and flew pell-mell into the trunk. 

“It’s not very neat,” said Tonks, walking over to the 
trunk and looking down at the jumble inside. “My 
mum’s got this knack of getting stuff to fit itself in 

Page | 68 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




neatly — she even gets the socks to fold themselves — 
but I’ve never mastered how she does it — it’s a kind 
of flick — ” 

She flicked her wand hopefully; one of Harry’s socks 
gave a feeble sort of wiggle and flopped back on top of 
the mess within. 

“Ah, well,” said Tonks, slamming the trunk’s lid shut, 
“at least it’s all in. That could do with a bit of 
cleaning, too — Scourgify — ” She pointed her wand at 
Hedwig’s cage; a few feathers and droppings 
vanished. “Well, that’s a bit better — I’ve never quite 
got the hang of these sort of householdy spells. Right 
— got everything? Cauldron? Broom? Wow! A 
Firebolt?” 

Her eyes widened as they fell on the broomstick in 
Harry’s right hand. It was his pride and joy, a gift 
from Sirius, an international standard broomstick. 

“And I’m still riding a Comet Two Sixty,” said Tonks 
enviously. “Ah well ... wand still in your jeans? Both 
buttocks still on? Okay, let’s go. Locomotor Trunk.” 

Harry’s trunk rose a few inches into the air. Holding 
her wand like a conductor’s baton, Tonks made it 
hover across the room and out of the door ahead of 
them, Hedwig’s cage in her left hand. Harry followed 
her down the stairs carrying his broomstick. 

Back in the kitchen, Moody had replaced his eye, 
which was spinning so fast after its cleaning it made 
Harry feel sick. Kingsley Shacklebolt and Sturgis 
Podmore were examining the microwave and Hestia 
Jones was laughing at a potato peeler she had come 
across while rummaging in the drawers. Lupin was 
sealing a letter addressed to the Dursleys. 



Page | 69 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Excellent,” said Lupin, looking up as Tonks and 
Harry entered. “We’ve got about a minute, I think. We 
should probably get out into the garden so we’re 
ready. Harry, I’ve left a letter telling your aunt and 
uncle not to worry — ” 

“They won’t,” said Harry. 

“That you’re safe — ” 

“That’ll just depress them.” 

“ — and you’ll see them next summer.” 

“Do I have to?” 

Lupin smiled but made no answer. 

“Come here, boy,” said Moody gruffly, beckoning 
Harry toward him with his wand. “I need to 
Disillusion you.” 

“You need to what?” said Harry nervously. 

“Disillusionment Charm,” said Moody, raising his 
wand. “Lupin says you’ve got an Invisibility Cloak, 
but it won’t stay on while we’re flying; this’ll disguise 
you better. Here you go — ” 

He rapped Harry hard on the top of the head and 
Harry felt a curious sensation as though Moody had 
just smashed an egg there; cold trickles seemed to be 
running down his body from the point the wand had 
struck. 

“Nice one, Mad-Eye,” said Tonks appreciatively, 
staring at Harry’s midriff. 



Page | 70 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Harry looked down at his body, or rather, what had 
been his body, for it didn’t look anything like his 
anymore. It was not invisible; it had simply taken on 
the exact color and texture of the kitchen unit behind 
him. He seemed to have become a human chameleon. 

“Come on,” said Moody, unlocking the back door with 
his wand. 

They all stepped outside onto Uncle Vernon’s 
beautifully kept lawn. 

“Clear night,” grunted Moody, his magical eye 
scanning the heavens. “Could’ve done with a bit more 
cloud cover. Right, you,” he barked at Harry, “we’re 
going to be flying in close formation. Tonks’ll be right 
in front of you, keep close on her tail. Lupin’ll be 
covering you from below. I’m going to be behind you. 
The rest’ll be circling us. We don’t break ranks for 
anything, got me? If one of us is killed — ” 

“Is that likely?” Harry asked apprehensively, but 
Moody ignored him. 

“ — the others keep flying, don’t stop, don’t break 
ranks. If they take out all of us and you survive, 

Harry, the rear guard are standing by to take over; 
keep flying east and they’ll join you.” 

“Stop being so cheerful, Mad-Eye, he’ll think we’re not 
taking this seriously,” said Tonks, as she strapped 
Harry’s trunk and Hedwig’s cage into a harness 
hanging from her broom. 

“I’m just telling the boy the plan,” growled Moody. 
“Our job’s to deliver him safely to headquarters and if 
we die in the attempt — ” 



Page | 71 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“No one’s going to die,” said Kingsley Shacklebolt in 
his deep, calming voice. 

“Mount your brooms, that’s the first signal!” said 
Lupin sharply, pointing into the sky. 

Far, far above them, a shower of bright red sparks 
had flared among the stars. Harry recognized them at 
once as wand sparks. He swung his right leg over his 
Firebolt, gripped its handle tightly, and felt it 
vibrating very slightly, as though it was as keen as he 
was to be up in the air once more. 

“Second signal, let’s go!” said Lupin loudly, as more 
sparks, green this time, exploded high above them. 

Harry kicked off hard from the ground. The cool night 
air rushed through his hair as the neat square 
gardens of Privet Drive fell away, shrinking rapidly 
into a patchwork of dark greens and blacks, and 
every thought of the Ministry hearing was swept from 
his mind as though the rush of air had blown it out of 
his head. He felt as though his heart was going to 
explode with pleasure; he was flying again, flying 
away from Privet Drive as he’d been fantasizing about 
all summer, he was going home... For a few glorious 
moments, all his problems seemed to recede into 
nothing, insignificant in the vast, starry sky. 

“Hard left, hard left, there’s a Muggle looking up!” 
shouted Moody from behind him. Tonks swerved and 
Harry followed her, watching his trunk swinging 
wildly beneath her broom. “We need more height... 
Give it another quarter of a mile!” 

Harry’s eyes watered in the chill as they soared 
upward; he could see nothing below now but tiny 
pinpricks of light that were car headlights and 
streetlamps. Two of those tiny lights might belong to 

Page | 72 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




Uncle Vernon’s car... The Dursleys would be heading 
back to their empty house right now, full of rage 
about the nonexistent lawn competition . . . and Harry 
laughed aloud at the thought, though his voice was 
drowned by the flapping of the others’ robes, the 
creaking of the harness holding his trunk and the 
cage, the whoosh of the wind in their ears as they 
sped through the air. He had not felt this alive in a 
month, or this happy... 

“Bearing south!” shouted Mad-Eye. “Town ahead!” 

They soared right, so that they did not pass directly 
over the glittering spiderweb of lights below. 

“Bear southeast and keep climbing, there’s some low 
cloud ahead we can lose ourselves in!” called Moody. 

“We’re not going through clouds!” shouted Tonks 
angrily. “We’ll get soaked, Mad-Eye!” 

Harry was relieved to hear her say this; his hands 
were growing numb on the Firebolt’s handle. He 
wished he had thought to put on a coat; he was 
starting to shiver. 

They altered their course every now and then 
according to Mad-Eye ’s instructions. Harry’s eyes 
were screwed up against the rush of icy wind that 
was starting to make his ears ache. He could 
remember being this cold on a broom only once 
before, during the Quidditch match against Hufflepuff 
in his third year, which had taken place in a storm. 
The guard around him was circling continuously like 
giant birds of prey. Harry lost track of time. He 
wondered how long they had been flying; it felt like an 
hour at least. 



Page | 73 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Turning southwest!” yelled Moody. “We want to avoid 
the motorway!” 

Harry was now so chilled that he thought longingly 
for a moment of the snug, dry interiors of the cars 
streaming along below, then, even more longingly, of 
traveling by Floo powder; it might be uncomfortable to 
spin around in fireplaces but it was at least warm in 
the flames... Kingsley Shacklebolt swooped around 
him, bald pate and earring gleaming slightly in the 
moonlight... Now Emmeline Vance was on his right, 
her wand out, her head turning left and right . . . then 
she too swooped over him, to be replaced by Sturgis 
Podmore... 

“We ought to double back for a bit, just to make sure 
we’re not being followed!” Moody shouted. 

“ARE YOU MAD, MAD-EYE?” Tonks screamed from 
the front. “We’re all frozen to our brooms! If we keep 
going off course we’re not going to get there until next 
week! We’re nearly there now!” 

“Time to start the descent!” came Lupin’s voice. 
“Follow Tonks, Harry!” 

Harry followed Tonks into a dive. They were heading 
for the largest collection of lights he had yet seen, a 
huge, sprawling, crisscrossing mass, glittering in lines 
and grids, interspersed with patches of deepest black. 
Lower and lower they flew, until Harry could see 
individual headlights and streetlamps, chimneys, and 
television aerials. He wanted to reach the ground very 
much, though he felt sure that someone would have 
to unfreeze him from his broom. 

“Here we go!” called Tonks, and a few seconds later 
she had landed. 



Page | 74 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Harry touched down right behind her and 
dismounted on a patch of unkempt grass in the 
middle of a small square. Tonks was already 
unbuckling Harry’s trunk. Shivering, Harry looked 
around. The grimy fronts of the surrounding houses 
were not welcoming; some of them had broken 
windows, glimmering dully in the light from the 
street-lamps, paint was peeling from many of the 
doors, and heaps of rubbish lay outside several sets 
of front steps. 

“Where are we?” Harry asked, but Lupin said quietly, 
“In a minute.” 

Moody was rummaging in his cloak, his gnarled 
hands clumsy with cold. 

“Got it,” he muttered, raising what looked like a silver 
cigarette lighter into the air and clicking it. 

The nearest streetlamp went out with a pop. He 
clicked the un-lighter again; the next lamp went out. 
He kept clicking until every lamp in the square was 
extinguished and the only light in the square came 
from curtained windows and the sickle moon 
overhead. 

“Borrowed it from Dumbledore,” growled Moody, 
pocketing the Put-Outer. “That’ll take care of any 
Muggles looking out of the window, see? Now, come 
on, quick.” 

He took Harry by the arm and led him from the patch 
of grass, across the road, and onto the pavement. 
Lupin and Tonks followed, carrying Harry’s trunk 
between them, the rest of the guard, all with their 
wands out, flanking them. 



Page | 75 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




The muffled pounding of a stereo was coming from an 
upper window in the nearest house. A pungent smell 
of rotting rubbish came from the pile of bulging bin- 
bags just inside the broken gate. 

“Here,” Moody muttered, thrusting a piece of 
parchment toward Harry’s Disillusioned hand and 
holding his lit wand close to it, so as to illuminate the 
writing. “Read quickly and memorize.” 

Harry looked down at the piece of paper. The narrow 
handwriting was vaguely familiar. It said: 

The headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix may he 
found at number twelve, Grimmauld Place, London. 



Page | 76 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 






NUMBER TWELVE, GRIMMAULD 
PLACE 

“What’s the Order of the — ?” Harry began. 

“Not here, boy!” snarled Moody. “Wait till we’re 
inside!” 

He pulled the piece of parchment out of Harry’s hand 
and set fire to it with his wand tip. As the message 
curled into flames and floated to the ground, Harry 
looked around at the houses again. They were 
standing outside number eleven; he looked to the left 
and saw number ten; to the right, however, was 
number thirteen. 

“But where’s — ?” 

“Think about what you’ve just memorized,” said Lupin 
quietly. 

Harry thought, and no sooner had he reached the 
part about number twelve, Grimmauld Place, than a 



Page | 77 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 



battered door emerged out of nowhere between 
numbers eleven and thirteen, followed swiftly by dirty 
walls and grimy windows. It was as though an extra 
house had inflated, pushing those on either side out 
of its way. Harry gaped at it. The stereo in number 
eleven thudded on. Apparently the Muggles inside 
hadn’t even felt anything. 

“Come on, hurry,” growled Moody, prodding Harry in 
the back. 

Harry walked up the worn stone steps, staring at the 
newly materialized door. Its black paint was shabby 
and scratched. The silver door knocker was in the 
form of a twisted serpent. There was no keyhole or 
letterbox. 

Lupin pulled out his wand and tapped the door once. 
Harry heard many loud, metallic clicks and what 
sounded like the clatter of a chain. The door creaked 
open. 

“Get in quick, Harry,” Lupin whispered. “But don’t go 
far inside and don’t touch anything.” 

Harry stepped over the threshold into the almost total 
darkness of the hall. He could smell damp, dust, and 
a sweetish, rotting smell; the place had the feeling of 
a derelict building. He looked over his shoulder and 
saw the others filing in behind him, Lupin and Tonks 
carrying his trunk and Hedwig’s cage. Moody was 
standing on the top step and releasing the balls of 
light the Put-Outer had stolen from the street-lamps; 
they flew back to their bulbs and the square beyond 
glowed momentarily with orange light before Moody 
limped inside and closed the front door, so that the 
darkness in the hall became complete. 

“Here — ” 

Page | 78 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




He rapped Harry hard over the head with his wand; 
Harry felt as though something hot was trickling 
down his back this time and knew that the 
Disillusionment Charm must have lifted. 

“Now stay still, everyone, while I give us a bit of light 
in here,” Moody whispered. 

The others’ hushed voices were giving Harry an odd 
feeling of foreboding; it was as though they had just 
entered the house of a dying person. He heard a soft 
hissing noise and then old-fashioned gas lamps 
sputtered into life all along the walls, casting a 
flickering insubstantial light over the peeling 
wallpaper and threadbare carpet of a long, gloomy 
hallway, where a cobwebby chandelier glimmered 
overhead and age-blackened portraits hung crooked 
on the walls. Harry heard something scuttling behind 
the baseboard. Both the chandelier and the 
candelabra on a rickety table nearby were shaped like 
serpents. 

There were hurried footsteps and Ron’s mother, Mrs. 
Weasley, emerged from a door at the far end of the 
hall. She was beaming in welcome as she hurried 
toward them, though Harry noticed that she was 
rather thinner and paler than she had been last time 
he had seen her. 

“Oh, Harry, it’s lovely to see you!” she whispered, 
pulling him into a rib-cracking hug before holding 
him at arm’s length and examining him critically. 
“You’re looking peaky; you need feeding up, but you’ll 
have to wait a bit for dinner, I’m afraid...” 

She turned to the gang of wizards behind him and 
whispered urgently, “He’s just arrived, the meeting’s 
started...” 



Page | 79 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




The wizards behind Harry all made noises of interest 
and excitement and began filing past Harry toward 
the door through which Mrs. Weasley had just come; 
Harry made to follow Lupin, but Mrs. Weasley held 
him back. 

“No, Harry, the meeting’s only for members of the 
Order. Ron and Hermione are upstairs, you can wait 
with them until the meeting’s over and then we’ll have 
dinner. And keep your voice down in the hall,” she 
added in an urgent whisper. 

“Why?” 

“I don’t want to wake anything up.” 

“What d’you — ?” 

“I’ll explain later, I’ve got to hurry, I’m supposed to be 
at the meeting — I’ll just show you where you’re 
sleeping.” 

Pressing her finger to her lips, she led him on tiptoes 
past a pair of long, moth-eaten curtains, behind 
which Harry supposed there must be another door, 
and after skirting a large umbrella stand that looked 
as though it had been made from a severed troll’s leg, 
they started up the dark staircase, passing a row of 
shrunken heads mounted on plaques on the wall. A 
closer look showed Harry that the heads belonged to 
house-elves. All of them had the same rather 
snoutlike nose. 

Harry’s bewilderment deepened with every step he 
took. What on earth were they doing in a house that 
looked as though it belonged to the Darkest of 
wizards? 

“Mrs. Weasley, why — ?” 

Page | 80 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Ron and Hermione will explain everything, dear, I’ve 
really got to dash,” Mrs. Weasley whispered 
distractedly. “There” — they had reached the second 
landing — “you’re the door on the right. I’ll call you 
when it’s over.” 

And she hurried off downstairs again. 

Harry crossed the dingy landing, turned the bedroom 
doorknob, which was shaped like a serpent’s head, 
and opened the door. 

He caught a brief glimpse of a gloomy high-ceilinged, 
twin-bedded room, then there was a loud twittering 
noise, followed by an even louder shriek, and his 
vision was completely obscured by a large quantity of 
very bushy hair — Hermione had thrown herself onto 
him in a hug that nearly knocked him flat, while 
Ron’s tiny owl, Pigwidgeon, zoomed excitedly round 
and round their heads. 

“HARRY! Ron, he’s here, Harry’s here! We didn’t hear 
you arrive! Oh, how are you? Are you all right? Have 
you been furious with us? I bet you have, I know our 
letters were useless — but we couldn’t tell you 
anything, Dumbledore made us swear we wouldn’t, 
oh, we’ve got so much to tell you, and you’ve got to 
tell us — the dementors! When we heard — and that 
Ministry hearing — it’s just outrageous, I’ve looked it 
all up, they can’t expel you, they just can’t, there’s 
provision in the Decree for the Restriction of 
Underage Sorcery for the use of magic in life- 
threatening situations — ” 

“Let him breathe, Hermione,” said Ron, grinning, 
closing the door behind Harry. He seemed to have 
grown several more inches during their month apart, 
making him taller and more gangly looking than ever, 



Page | 81 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




though the long nose, bright red hair, and freckles 
were the same. 

Hermione, still beaming, let go of Harry, but before 
she could say another word there was a soft 
whooshing sound and something white soared from 
the top of a dark wardrobe and landed gently on 
Harry’s shoulder. 

“Hedwig!” 

The snowy owl clicked her beak and nibbled his ear 
affectionately as Harry stroked her feathers. 

“She’s been in a right state,” said Ron. “Pecked us 
half to death when she brought your last letters, look 
at this — ” 

He showed Harry the index finger of his right hand, 
which sported a half-healed but clearly deep cut. 

“Oh yeah,” Harry said. “Sorry about that, but I 
wanted answers, you know...” 

“We wanted to give them to you, mate,” said Ron. 
“Hermione was going spare, she kept saying you’d do 
something stupid if you were stuck all on your own 
without news, but Dumbledore made us — ” 

“ — swear not to tell me,” said Harry. “Yeah, 
Hermione’s already said.” 

The warm glow that had flared inside him at the sight 
of his two best friends was extinguished as something 
icy flooded the pit of his stomach. All of a sudden — 
after yearning to see them for a solid month — he felt 
he would rather Ron and Hermione left him alone. 



Page | 82 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




There was a strained silence in which Harry stroked 
Hedwig automatically, not looking at either of the 
others. 

“He seemed to think it was best,” said Hermione 
rather breathlessly. “Dumbledore, I mean.” 

“Right,” said Harry. He noticed that her hands too 
bore the marks of Hedwig’s beak and found that he 
was not at all sorry. 

“I think he thought you were safest with the Muggles 
— ” Ron began. 

“Yeah?” said Harry, raising his eyebrows. “Have either 
of you been attacked by dementors this summer?” 

“Well, no — but that’s why he’s had people from the 
Order of the Phoenix tailing you all the time — ” 

Harry felt a great jolt in his guts as though he had 
just missed a step going downstairs. So everyone had 
known he was being followed except him. 

“Didn’t work that well, though, did it?” said Harry, 
doing his utmost to keep his voice even. “Had to look 
after myself after all, didn’t I?” 

“He was so angry,” said Hermione in an almost 
awestruck voice. “Dumbledore. We saw him. When he 
found out Mundungus had left before his shift had 
ended. He was scary.” 

“Well, I’m glad he left,” Harry said coldly. “If he 
hadn’t, I wouldn’t have done magic and Dumbledore 
would probably have left me at Privet Drive all 
summer.” 



Page | 83 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Aren’t you ... aren’t you worried about the Ministry of 
Magic hearing?” said Hermione quietly. 

“No,” Harry lied defiantly. He walked away from them, 
looking around, with Hedwig nestled contentedly on 
his shoulder, but this room was not likely to raise his 
spirits. It was dank and dark. A blank stretch of 
canvas in an ornate picture frame was all that 
relieved the bareness of the peeling walls and as 
Harry passed it he thought he heard someone lurking 
out of sight snigger. 

“So why’s Dumbledore been so keen to keep me in the 
dark?” Harry asked, still trying hard to keep his voice 
casual. “Did you — er — bother to ask him at all?” 

He glanced up just in time to see them exchanging a 
look that told him he was behaving just as they had 
feared he would. It did nothing to improve his temper. 

“We told Dumbledore we wanted to tell you what was 
going on,” said Ron. “We did, mate. But he’s really 
busy now, we’ve only seen him twice since we came 
here and he didn’t have much time, he just made us 
swear not to tell you important stuff when we wrote, 
he said the owls might be intercepted — ” 

“He could still’ve kept me informed if he’d wanted to,” 
Harry said shortly. “You’re not telling me he doesn’t 
know ways to send messages without owls.” 

Hermione glanced at Ron and then said, “I thought 
that too. But he didn’t want you to know anything.” 

“Maybe he thinks I can’t be trusted,” said Harry, 
watching their expressions. 

“Don’t be thick,” said Ron, looking highly 
disconcerted. 

Page | 84 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Or that I can’t take care of myself — ” 



“Of course he doesn’t think that!” said Hermione 
anxiously. 

“So how come I have to stay at the Dursleys’ while 
you two get to join in everything that’s going on 
here?” said Harry, the words tumbling over one 
another in a rush, his voice growing louder with every 
word. “How come you two are allowed to know 
everything that’s going on — ?” 

“We’re not!” Ron interrupted. “Mum won’t let us near 
the meetings, she says we’re too young — ” 

But before he knew it, Harry was shouting. 

“SO YOU HAVEN’T BEEN IN THE MEETINGS, BIG 
DEAL! YOUVE STILL BEEN HERE, HAVEN T YOU? 
YOUVE STILL BEEN TOGETHER! ME, IVE BEEN 
STUCK AT THE DURSLEYS’ FOR A MONTH! AND IVE 
HANDLED MORE THAN YOU TWOVE EVER 
MANAGED AND DUMBLEDORE KNOWS IT — WHO 
SAVED THE SORCERER’S STONE? WHO GOT RID 
OF RIDDLE? WHO SAVED BOTH YOUR SKINS FROM 
THE DEMENTORS?” 

Every bitter and resentful thought that Harry had had 
in the past month was pouring out of him; his 
frustration at the lack of news, the hurt that they had 
all been together without him, his fury at being 
followed and not told about it: All the feelings he was 
half-ashamed of finally burst their boundaries. 

Hedwig took fright at the noise and soared off on top 
of the wardrobe again; Pigwidgeon twittered in alarm 
and zoomed even faster around their heads. 

“WHO HAD TO GET PAST DRAGONS AND SPHINXES 
AND EVERY OTHER FOUL THING LAST YEAR? WHO 

Page | 85 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




SAW HIM COME BACK? WHO HAD TO ESCAPE 
FROM HIM? ME!” 



Ron was standing there with his mouth half-open, 
clearly stunned and at a loss for anything to say, 
while Hermione looked on the verge of tears. 

“BUT WHY SHOULD I KNOW WHAT’S GOING ON? 
WHY SHOULD ANYONE BOTHER TO TELL ME 
WHAT’S BEEN HAPPENING?” 



“Harry, we wanted to tell you, we really did — ” 
Hermione began. 



“CANTVE WANTED TO THAT MUCH, CAN YOU, OR 
YOU’D HAVE SENT ME AN OWL, BUT DUMBLEDORE 
MADE YOU SWEAR — ” 



“Well, he did — ” 

“FOUR WEEKS IVE BEEN STUCK IN PRIVET DRIVE, 
NICKING PAPERS OUT OF BINS TO TRY AND FIND 
OUT WHAT’S BEEN GOING ON — ” 



“We wanted to — ” 

“I SUPPOSE YOUVE BEEN HAVING A REAL LAUGH, 
HAVENT YOU, ALL HOLED UP HERE TOGETHER — ” 

“No, honest — ” 

“Harry, we’re really sorry!” said Hermione desperately, 
her eyes now sparkling with tears. “You’re absolutely 
right, Harry — I’d be furious if it was me!” 

Harry glared at her, still breathing deeply, then 
turned away from them again, pacing up and down. 
Hedwig hooted glumly from the top of the wardrobe. 



Page | 86 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




There was a long pause, broken only by the mournful 
creak of the floorboards below Harry’s feet. 

“What is this place anyway?” he shot at Ron and 
Hermione. 

“Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix,” said Ron 
at once. 

“Is anyone going to bother telling me what the Order 
of the Phoenix — ?” 

“It’s a secret society,” said Hermione quickly. 
“Dumbledore’s in charge, he founded it. It’s the people 
who fought against You-Know-Who last time.” 

“Who’s in it?” said Harry, coming to a halt with his 
hands in his pockets. 

“Quite a few people — ” 

“ — we’ve met about twenty of them,” said Ron, “but 
we think there are more...” 

Harry glared at them. 

“ Well?” he demanded, looking from one to the other. 
“Er,” said Ron. “Well what?” 

“Voldemorti” said Harry furiously, and both Ron and 
Hermione winced. “What’s happening? What’s he up 
to? Where is he? What are we doing to stop him?” 

“We’ve told you, the Order don’t let us in on their 
meetings,” said Hermione nervously. “So we don’t 
know the details — but we’ve got a general idea — ” 
she added hastily, seeing the look on Harry’s face. 



Page | 87 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Fred and George have invented Extendable Ears, 
see,” said Ron. “They’re really useful.” 



“Extendable — ?” 

“Ears, yeah. Only we’ve had to stop using them lately 
because Mum found out and went berserk. Fred and 
George had to hide them all to stop Mum binning 
them. But we got a good bit of use out of them before 
Mum realized what was going on. We know some of 
the Order are following known Death Eaters, keeping 
tabs on them, you know — ” 

“ — some of them are working on recruiting more 
people to the Order — ” said Hermione. 

“ — and some of them are standing guard over 
something,” said Ron. “They’re always talking about 
guard duty.” 

“Couldn’t have been me, could it?” said Harry 
sarcastically. 

“Oh yeah,” said Ron, with a look of dawning 
comprehension. 

Harry snorted. He walked around the room again, 
looking anywhere but at Ron and Hermione. “So what 
have you two been doing, if you’re not allowed in 
meetings?” he demanded. “You said you’d been busy.” 

“We have,” said Hermione quickly. “We’ve been 
decontaminating this house, it’s been empty for ages 
and stuff’s been breeding in here. We’ve managed to 
clean out the kitchen, most of the bedrooms, and I 
think we’re doing the drawing room tomo — AARGH!” 

With two loud cracks, Fred and George, Ron’s elder 
twin brothers, had materialized out of thin air in the 

Page | 88 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




middle of the room. Pigwidgeon twittered more wildly 
than ever and zoomed off to join Hedwig on top of the 
wardrobe. 

“Stop doing that!” Hermione said weakly to the twins, 
who were as vividly red-haired as Ron, though 
stockier and slightly shorter. 

“Hello, Harry,” said George, beaming at him. “We 
thought we heard your dulcet tones.” 

“You don’t want to bottle up your anger like that, 
Harry, let it all out,” said Fred, also beaming. “There 
might be a couple of people fifty miles away who 
didn’t hear you.” 

“You two passed your Apparation tests, then?” asked 
Harry grumpily. 

“With distinction,” said Fred, who was holding what 
looked like a piece of very long, flesh-colored string. 

“It would have taken you about thirty seconds longer 
to walk down the stairs,” said Ron. 

“Time is Galleons, little brother,” said Fred. “Anyway, 
Harry, you’re interfering with reception. Extendable 
Ears,” he added in response to Harry’s raised 
eyebrows, holding up the string, which Harry now 
saw was trailing out onto the landing. “We’re trying to 
hear what’s going on downstairs.” 

“You want to be careful,” said Ron, staring at the ear. 
“If Mum sees one of them again ...” 

“It’s worth the risk, that’s a major meeting they’re 
having,” said Fred. 



Page | 89 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




The door opened and a long mane of red hair 
appeared. 

“Oh hello, Harry!” said Ron’s younger sister, Ginny, 
brightly. “I thought I heard your voice.” 

Turning to Fred and George she said, “It’s no go with 
the Extendable Ears, she’s gone and put an 
Imperturbable Charm on the kitchen door.” 

“How d’you know?” said George, looking crestfallen. 

“Tonks told me how to find out,” said Ginny. “You just 
chuck stuff at the door and if it can’t make contact 
the door’s been Imperturbed. I’ve been flicking 
Dungbombs at it from the top of the stairs and they 
just soar away from it, so there’s no way the 
Extendable Ears will be able to get under the gap.” 

Fred heaved a deep sigh. “Shame. I really fancied 
finding out what old Snape’s been up to.” 

“Snape?” said Harry quickly. “Is he here?” 

“Yeah,” said George, carefully closing the door and 
sitting down on one of the beds; Fred and Ginny 
followed. “Giving a report. Top secret.” 

“Git,” said Fred idly. 

“He’s on our side now,” said Hermione reprovingly. 

Ron snorted. “Doesn’t stop him being a git. The way 
he looks at us when he sees us...” 

“Bill doesn’t like him either,” said Ginny, as though 
that settled the matter. 



Page | 90 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Harry was not sure his anger had abated yet; but his 
thirst for information was now overcoming his urge to 
keep shouting. He sank onto the bed opposite the 
others. 

“Is Bill here?” he asked. “I thought he was working in 
Egypt.” 

“He applied for a desk job so he could come home and 
work for the Order,” said Fred. “He says he misses the 
tombs, but,” he smirked, “there are compensations...” 

“What d’you mean?” 

“Remember old Fleur Delacour?” said George. “She’s 
got a job at Gringotts to eemprove ’er Eeenglish — ” 

“ — and Bill’s been giving her a lot of private lessons,” 
sniggered Fred. 

“Charlie’s in the Order too,” said George, “but he’s 
still in Romania, Dumbledore wants as many foreign 
wizards brought in as possible, so Charlie’s trying to 
make contacts on his days off.” 

“Couldn’t Percy do that?” Harry asked. The last he 
had heard, the third Weasley brother was working in 
the Department of International Magical Cooperation 
at the Ministry of Magic. 

At these words all the Weasleys and Hermione 
exchanged darkly significant looks. 

“Whatever you do, don’t mention Percy in front of 
Mum and Dad,” Ron told Harry in a tense voice. 

“Why not?” 



Page | 91 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




“Because every time Percy’s name’s mentioned, Dad 
breaks whatever he’s holding and Mum starts crying,” 
Fred said. 

“It’s been awful,” said Ginny sadly. 

“I think we’re well shut of him,” said George with an 
uncharacteristically ugly look on his face. 

“What’s happened?” Harry said. 

“Percy and Dad had a row,” said Fred. “I’ve never seen 
Dad row with anyone like that. It’s normally Mum 
who shouts...” 

“It was the first week back after term ended,” said 
Ron. “We were about to come and join the Order. 
Percy came home and told us he’d been promoted.” 

“You’re kidding?” said Harry. 

Though he knew perfectly well that Percy was highly 
ambitious, Harry’s impression was that Percy had not 
made a great success of his first job at the Ministry of 
Magic. Percy had committed the fairly large oversight 
of failing to notice that his boss was being controlled 
by Lord Voldemort (not that the Ministry had believed 
that — they all thought that Mr. Crouch had gone 
mad). 

“Yeah, we were all surprised,” said George, “because 
Percy got into a load of trouble about Crouch, there 
was an inquiry and everything. They said Percy ought 
to have realized Crouch was off his rocker and 
informed a superior. But you know Percy, Crouch left 
him in charge, he wasn’t going to complain...” 

“So how come they promoted him?” 



Page | 92 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“That’s exactly what we wondered,” said Ron, who 
seemed very keen to keep normal conversation going 
now that Harry had stopped yelling. “He came home 
really pleased with himself — even more pleased than 
usual if you can imagine that — and told Dad he’d 
been offered a position in Fudge’s own office. A really 
good one for someone only a year out of Hogwarts — 
Junior Assistant to the Minister. He expected Dad to 
be all impressed, I think.” 

“Only Dad wasn’t,” said Fred grimly. 

“Why not?” said Harry. 

“Well, apparently Fudge has been storming round the 
Ministry checking that nobody’s having any contact 
with Dumbledore,” said George. 

“Dumbledore’s name’s mud with the Ministry these 
days, see,” said Fred. “They all think he’s just making 
trouble saying You-Know- Who’s back.” 

“Dad says Fudge has made it clear that anyone who’s 
in league with Dumbledore can clear out their desks,” 
said George. 

“Trouble is, Fudge suspects Dad, he knows he’s 
friendly with Dumbledore, and he’s always thought 
Dad’s a bit of a weirdo because of his Muggle 
obsession — ” 

“But what’s this got to do with Percy?” asked Harry, 
confused. 

“I’m coming to that. Dad reckons Fudge only wants 
Percy in his office because he wants to use him to spy 
on the family — and Dumbledore.” 



Harry let out a low whistle. 

Page | 93 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




“Bet Percy loved that.” 

Ron laughed in a hollow sort of way. 

“He went completely berserk. He said — well, he said 
loads of terrible stuff. He said he’s been having to 
struggle against Dad’s lousy reputation ever since he 
joined the Ministry and that Dad’s got no ambition 
and that’s why we’ve always been — you know — not 
had a lot of money, I mean — ” 

“ What?” said Harry in disbelief, as Ginny made a 
noise like an angry cat. 

“I know,” said Ron in a low voice. “And it got worse. 

He said Dad was an idiot to run around with 
Dumbledore, that Dumbledore was heading for big 
trouble and Dad was going to go down with him, and 
that he — Percy — knew where his loyalty lay and it 
was with the Ministry. And if Mum and Dad were 
going to become traitors to the Ministry he was going 
to make sure everyone knew he didn’t belong to our 
family anymore. And he packed his bags the same 
night and left. He’s living here in London now.” 

Harry swore under his breath. He had always liked 
Percy least of Ron’s brothers, but he had never 
imagined he would say such things to Mr. Weasley. 

“Mum’s been in a right state,” said Ron. “You know — 
crying and stuff. She came up to London to try and 
talk to Percy but he slammed the door in her face. I 
dunno what he does if he meets Dad at work — 
ignores him, I s’pose.” 

“But Percy must know Voldemort’s back,” said Harry 
slowly. “He’s not stupid, he must know your mum 
and dad wouldn’t risk everything without proof — ” 



Page | 94 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Yeah, well, your name got dragged into the row,” said 
Ron, shooting Harry a furtive look. “Percy said the 
only evidence was your word and ... I dunno ... he 
didn’t think it was good enough.” 

“Percy takes the Daily Prophet seriously,” said 
Hermione tartly, and the others all nodded. 

“What are you talking about?” Harry asked, looking 
around at them all. They were all regarding him 
warily. 

“Haven’t — haven’t you been getting the Daily 
Prophet?” Hermione asked nervously. 

“Yeah, I have!” said Harry. 

“Have you — er — been reading it thoroughly?” 
Hermione asked still more anxiously. 

“Not cover to cover,” said Harry defensively. “If they 
were going to report anything about Voldemort it 
would be headline news, wouldn’t it!” 

The others flinched at the sound of the name. 
Hermione hurried on, “Well, you’d need to read it 
cover to cover to pick it up, but they — um — they 
mention you a couple of times a week.” 

“But I’d have seen — ” 

“Not if you’ve only been reading the front page, you 
wouldn’t,” said Hermione, shaking her head. “I’m not 
talking about big articles. They just slip you in, like 
you’re a standing joke.” 

“What d’you — ?” 



Page | 95 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




“It’s quite nasty, actually,” said Hermione in a voice of 
forced calm. “They’re just building on Rita’s stuff.” 

“But she’s not writing for them anymore, is she?” 

“Oh no, she’s kept her promise — not that she’s got 
any choice,” Hermione added with satisfaction. “But 
she laid the foundation for what they’re trying to do 
now.” 

“Which is what?” said Harry impatiently. 

“Okay, you know she wrote that you were collapsing 
all over the place and saying your scar was hurting 
and all that?” 

“Yeah,” said Harry, who was not likely to forget Rita 
Skeeter’s stories about him in a hurry. 

“Well, they’re writing about you as though you’re this 
deluded, attention-seeking person who thinks he’s a 
great tragic hero or something,” said Hermione, very 
fast, as though it would be less unpleasant for Harry 
to hear these facts quickly. “They keep slipping in 
snide comments about you. If some far-fetched story 
appears they say something like ‘a tale worthy of 
Harry Potter’ and if anyone has a funny accident or 
anything it’s let’s hope he hasn’t got a scar on his 
forehead or we’ll be asked to worship him next — ’ ” 

“I don’t want anyone to worship — ” Harry began 
hotly. 

“I know you don’t,” said Hermione quickly, looking 
frightened. “I know, Harry. But you see what they’re 
doing? They want to turn you into someone nobody 
will believe. Fudge is behind it, I’ll bet anything. They 
want wizards on the street to think you’re just some 
stupid boy who’s a bit of a joke, who tells ridiculous 
Page | 96 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




tall stories because he loves being famous and wants 
to keep it going.” 

“I didn’t ask — I didn’t want — Voldemort killed my 
parentsV’ Harry spluttered. “I got famous because he 
murdered my family but couldn’t kill me! Who wants 
to be famous for that? Don’t they think I’d rather it’d 
never — ” 

“We know, Harry,” said Ginny earnestly. 

“And of course, they didn’t report a word about the 
dementors attacking you,” said Hermione. “Someone’s 
told them to keep that quiet. That should’ve been a 
really big story, out-of-control dementors. They 
haven’t even reported that you broke the International 
Statute of Secrecy — we thought they would, it would 
tie in so well with this image of you as some stupid 
show-off — we think they’re biding their time until 
you’re expelled, then they’re really going to go to town 
— I mean, if you’re expelled, obviously,” she went on 
hastily, “you really shouldn’t be, not if they abide by 
their own laws, there’s no case against you.” 

They were back on the hearing and Harry did not 
want to think about it. He cast around for another 
change of subject, but was saved the necessity of 
finding one by the sound of footsteps coming up the 
stairs. 

“Uh-oh.” 

Fred gave the Extendable Ear a hearty tug; there was 
another loud crack and he and George vanished. 
Seconds later, Mrs. Weasley appeared in the bedroom 
doorway. 

“The meeting’s over, you can come down and have 
dinner now, everyone’s dying to see you, Harry. And 

Page | 97 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




who’s left all those Dungbombs outside the kitchen 
door?” 



“Crookshanks,” said Ginny unblushingly. “He loves 
playing with them.” 

“Oh,” said Mrs. Weasley, “I thought it might have 
been Kreacher, he keeps doing odd things like that. 
Now don’t forget to keep your voices down in the hall. 
Ginny, your hands are filthy, what have you been 
doing? Go and wash them before dinner, please...” 

Ginny grimaced at the others and followed her mother 
out of the room, leaving Harry alone with Ron and 
Hermione again. Both of them were watching him 
apprehensively, as though they feared that he would 
start shouting again now that everyone else had gone. 
The sight of them looking so nervous made him feel 
slightly ashamed. 

“Look ...” he muttered, but Ron shook his head, and 
Hermione said quietly, “We knew you’d be angry, 
Harry, we really don’t blame you, but you’ve got to 
understand, we did try and persuade Dumbledore — ” 

“Yeah, I know,” said Harry grudgingly. 

He cast around for a topic to change the subject from 
Dumbledore — the very thought of him made Harry’s 
insides burn with anger again. 

“Who’s Kreacher?” he asked. 

“The house-elf who lives here,” said Ron. “Nutter. 
Never met one like him.” 

Hermione frowned at Ron. 

“He’s not a nutter, Ron — ” 

Page | 98 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




“His life’s ambition is to have his head cut off and 
stuck up on a plaque just like his mother,” said Ron 
irritably. “Is that normal, Hermione?” 

“Well — well, if he is a bit strange, it’s not his fault — ” 

Ron rolled his eyes at Harry. 

“Hermione still hasn’t given up on spew — ” 

“It’s not ‘spew’!” said Hermione heatedly. “It’s the 
Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare, and it’s 
not just me, Dumbledore says we should be kind to 
Kreacher too — ” 

“Yeah, yeah,” said Ron. “C’mon, I’m starving.” 

He led the way out of the door and onto the landing, 
but before they could descend the stairs — “Hold it!” 
Ron breathed, flinging out an arm to stop Harry and 
Hermione walking any farther. “They’re still in the 
hall, we might be able to hear something — ” 

The three of them looked cautiously over the 
banisters. The gloomy hallway below was packed with 
witches and wizards, including all of Harry’s guard. 
They were whispering excitedly together. In the very 
center of the group Harry saw the dark, greasy-haired 
head and prominent nose of his least favorite teacher 
at Hogwarts, Professor Snape. Harry leaned farther 
over the banisters. He was very interested in what 
Snape was doing for the Order of the Phoenix. . . 

A thin piece of flesh-colored string descended in front 
of Harry’s eyes. Looking up he saw Fred and George 
on the landing above, cautiously lowering the 
Extendable Ear toward the dark knot of people below. 
A moment later, however, they began to move toward 
the front door and out of sight. 

Page | 99 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




“Dammit,” Harry heard Fred whisper, as he hoisted 
the Extendable Ear back up again. 

They heard the front door open and then close. 

“Snape never eats here,” Ron told Harry quietly. 
“Thank God. C’mon.” 

“And don’t forget to keep your voice down in the hall, 
Harry,” Hermione whispered. 

As they passed the row of house-elf heads on the wall 
they saw Lupin, Mrs. Weasley, and Tonks at the front 
door, magically sealing its many locks and bolts 
behind those who had just left. 

“We’re eating down in the kitchen,” Mrs. Weasley 
whispered, meeting them at the bottom of the stairs. 
“Harry, dear, if youll just tiptoe across the hall, it’s 
through this door here — ” 

CRASH. 

“Tonksl” cried Mrs. Weasley exasperatedly, turning to 
look behind her. 

“I’m sorry!” wailed Tonks, who was lying flat on the 
floor. “It’s that stupid umbrella stand, that’s the 
second time I’ve tripped over — ” 

But the rest of her words were drowned by a horrible, 
earsplitting, bloodcurdling screech. 

The moth-eaten velvet curtains Harry had passed 
earlier had flown apart, but there was no door behind 
them. For a split second, Harry thought he was 
looking through a window, a window behind which an 
old woman in a black cap was screaming and 
screaming as though she was being tortured — then 
Page | lOOHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




he realized it was simply a life-size portrait, but the 
most realistic, and the most unpleasant, he had ever 
seen in his life. 

The old woman was drooling, her eyes were rolling, 
the yellowing skin of her face stretched taut as she 
screamed, and all along the hall behind them, the 
other portraits awoke and began to yell too, so that 
Harry actually screwed up his eyes at the noise and 
clapped his hands over his ears. 

Lupin and Mrs. Weasley darted forward and tried to 
tug the curtains shut over the old woman, but they 
would not close and she screeched louder than ever, 
brandishing clawed hands as though trying to tear at 
their faces. 

“Filth! Scum! By-products of dirt and vileness! Half- 
breeds, mutants, freaks, begone from this place! How 
dare you befoul the house of my fathers — ” 

Tonks apologized over and over again, at the same 
time dragging the huge, heavy troll’s leg back off the 
floor. Mrs. Weasley abandoned the attempt to close 
the curtains and hurried up and down the hall, 
Stunning all the other portraits with her wand. Then 
a man with long black hair came charging out of a 
door facing Harry. 

“Shut up, you horrible old hag, shut UP!” he roared, 
seizing the curtain Mrs. Weasley had abandoned. 

The old woman’s face blanched. 

“Yooooul” she howled, her eyes popping at the sight of 
the man. “Blood traitor, abomination, shame of my 
fleshl” 



Page | lOlHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“I said — shut — UP!” roared the man, and with a 
stupendous effort he and Lupin managed to force the 
curtains closed again. 

The old woman’s screeches died and an echoing 
silence fell. 

Panting slightly and sweeping his long dark hair out 
of his eyes, Harry’s godfather, Sirius, turned to face 
him. 

“Hello, Harry,” he said grimly, “I see you’ve met my 
mother.”

THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX 

“Your — ?” 

“My dear old mum, yeah,” said Sirius. “We’ve been 
trying to get her down for a month but we think she 
put a Permanent Sticking Charm on the back of the 
canvas. Let’s get downstairs, quick, before they all 
wake up again.” 

“But what’s a portrait of your mother doing here?” 
Harry asked, bewildered, as they went through the 
door from the hall and led the way down a flight of 
narrow stone steps, the others just behind them. 

“Hasn’t anyone told you? This was my parents’ 
house,” said Sirius. “But I’m the last Black left, so it’s 
mine now. I offered it to Dumbledore for headquarters 
— about the only useful thing I’ve been able to do.” 

Harry, who had expected a better welcome, noted how 
hard and bitter Sirius’s voice sounded. He followed 
his godfather to the bottom of the stairs and through 
a door leading into the basement kitchen. 

Page | 103Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 



It was scarcely less gloomy than the hall above, a 
cavernous room with rough stone walls. Most of the 
light was coming from a large fire at the far end of the 
room. A haze of pipe smoke hung in the air like battle 
fumes, through which loomed the menacing shapes of 
heavy iron pots and pans hanging from the dark 
ceiling. Many chairs had been crammed into the room 
for the meeting and a long wooden table stood in the 
middle of the room, littered with rolls of parchment, 
goblets, empty wine bottles, and a heap of what 
appeared to be rags. Mr. Weasley and his eldest son, 
Bill, were talking quietly with their heads together at 
the end of the table. 

Mrs. Weasley cleared her throat. Her husband, a thin, 
balding, red-haired man, who wore horn-rimmed 
glasses, looked around and jumped to his feet. 

“Harry!” Mr. Weasley said, hurrying forward to greet 
him and shaking his hand vigorously. “Good to see 
you!” 

Over his shoulder Harry saw Bill, who still wore his 
long hair in a ponytail, hastily rolling up the lengths 
of parchment left on the table. 

“Journey all right, Harry?” Bill called, trying to gather 
up twelve scrolls at once. “Mad-Eye didn’t make you 
come via Greenland, then?” 

“He tried,” said Tonks, striding over to help Bill and 
immediately sending a candle toppling onto the last 
piece of parchment. “Oh no — sorry — ” 

“Here, dear,” said Mrs. Weasley, sounding 
exasperated, and she repaired the parchment with a 
wave of her wand: In the flash of light caused by Mrs. 
Weasley’s charm, Harry caught a glimpse of what 
looked like the plan of a building. 

Page | 104Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Mrs. Weasley had seen him looking. She snatched the 
plan off the table and stuffed it into Bill’s heavily 
laden arms. 

“This sort of thing ought to be cleared away promptly 
at the end of meetings,” she snapped before sweeping 
off toward an ancient dresser from which she started 
unloading dinner plates. 

Bill took out his wand, muttered “Evanescol” and the 
scrolls vanished. 

“Sit down, Harry,” said Sirius. “You’ve met 
Mundungus, haven’t you?” 

The thing Harry had taken to be a pile of rags gave a 
prolonged, grunting snore and then jerked awake. 

“Some’n say m’ name?” Mundungus mumbled 
sleepily. “I ’gree with Sirius...” 

He raised a very grubby hand in the air as though 
voting, his droopy, bloodshot eyes unfocused. Ginny 
giggled. 

“The meeting’s over, Dung,” said Sirius, as they all sat 
down around him at the table. “Harry’s arrived.” 

“Eh?” said Mundungus, peering balefully at Harry 
through his matted ginger hair. “Blimey, so ’e ’as. 

Yeah ... you all right, ’arry?” 

“Yeah,” said Harry. 

Mundungus fumbled nervously in his pockets, still 
staring at Harry, and pulled out a grimy black pipe. 

He stuck it in his mouth, ignited the end of it with his 
wand, and took a deep pull on it. Great billowing 
clouds of greenish smoke obscured him in seconds. 
Page | 105Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Owe you a ’pology,” grunted a voice from the middle 
of the smelly cloud. 

“For the last time, Mundungus,” called Mrs. Weasley, 
“will you please not smoke that thing in the kitchen, 
especially not when we’re about to eat!” 

“Ah,” said Mundungus. “Right. Sorry, Molly.” 

The cloud of smoke vanished as Mundungus stowed 
his pipe back in his pocket, but an acrid smell of 
burning socks lingered. 

“And if you want dinner before midnight I’ll need a 
hand,” Mrs. Weasley said to the room at large. “No, 
you can stay where you are, Harry dear, you’ve had a 
long journey — ” 

“What can I do, Molly?” said Tonks enthusiastically, 
bounding forward. 

Mrs. Weasley hesitated, looking apprehensive. 

“Er — no, it’s all right, Tonks, you have a rest too, 
you’ve done enough today — ” 

“No, no, I want to help!” said Tonks brightly, knocking 
over a chair as she hurried toward the dresser from 
which Ginny was collecting cutlery. 

Soon a series of heavy knives were chopping meat 
and vegetables of their own accord, supervised by Mr. 
Weasley, while Mrs. Weasley stirred a cauldron 
dangling over the fire and the others took out plates, 
more goblets, and food from the pantry. Harry was 
left at the table with Sirius and Mundungus, who was 
still blinking mournfully at him. 

“Seen old Figgy since?” he asked. 

Page | 106Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“No,” said Harry, “I haven’t seen anyone.” 



“See, I wouldn’t ’ave left,” said Mundungus, leaning 
forward, a pleading note in his voice, “but I ’ad a 
business opportunity — ” 

Harry felt something brush against his knees and 
started, but it was only Crookshanks, Hermione’s 
bandy-legged ginger cat, who wound himself once 
around Harry’s legs, purring, then jumped onto 
Sirius’s lap and curled up. Sirius scratched him 
absentmindedly behind the ears as he turned, still 
grim-faced, to Harry. 

“Had a good summer so far?” 

“No, it’s been lousy,” said Harry. 

For the first time, something like a grin flitted across 
Sirius’s face. 

“Don’t know what you’re complaining about, myself.” 

“ What?” said Harry incredulously. 

“Personally, I’d have welcomed a dementor attack. A 
deadly struggle for my soul would have broken the 
monotony nicely. You think you’ve had it bad, at least 
you’ve been able to get out and about, stretch your 
legs, get into a few fights... I’ve been stuck inside for a 
month.” 

“How come?” asked Harry, frowning. 

“Because the Ministry of Magic’s still after me, and 
Voldemort will know all about me being an Animagus 
by now, Wormtail will have told him, so my big 
disguise is useless. There’s not much I can do for the 
Order of the Phoenix ... or so Dumbledore feels.” 

Page | 107Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




There was something about the slightly flattened tone 
of voice in which Sirius uttered Dumbledore’s name 
that told Harry that Sirius was not very happy with 
the headmaster either. Harry felt a sudden upsurge of 
affection for his godfather. 

“At least you’ve known what’s been going on,” he said 
bracingly. 

“Oh yeah,” said Sirius sarcastically. “Listening to 
Snape’s reports, having to take all his snide hints that 
he’s out there risking his life while I’m sat on my 
backside here having a nice comfortable time . . . 
asking me how the cleaning’s going — ” 

“What cleaning?” asked Harry. 

“Trying to make this place fit for human habitation,” 
said Sirius, waving a hand around the dismal 
kitchen. “No one’s lived here for ten years, not since 
my dear mother died, unless you count her old 
house-elf, and he’s gone round the twist, hasn’t 
cleaned anything in ages — ” 

“Sirius?” said Mundungus, who did not appear to 
have paid any attention to this conversation, but had 
been minutely examining an empty goblet. “This solid 
silver, mate?” 

“Yes,” said Sirius, surveying it with distaste. “Finest 
fifteenth-century goblin-wrought silver, embossed 
with the Black family crest.” 

“That’d come off, though,” muttered Mundungus, 
polishing it with his cuff. 

“Fred — George — NO, JUST CARRY THEM!” Mrs. 
Weasley shrieked. 



Page | 108Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Harry, Sirius, and Mundungus looked around and, a 
split second later, dived away from the table. Fred 
and George had bewitched a large cauldron of stew, 
an iron flagon of butterbeer, and a heavy wooden 
breadboard, complete with knife, to hurtle through 
the air toward them. The stew skidded the length of 
the table and came to a halt just before the end, 
leaving a long black burn on the wooden surface, the 
flagon of butterbeer fell with a crash, spilling its 
contents everywhere, and the bread knife slipped off 
the board and landed, point down and quivering 
ominously, exactly where Sirius’s right hand had 
been seconds before. 

“FOR HEAVEN’S SAKE!” screamed Mrs. Weasley. 
“THERE WAS NO NEED — IVE HAD ENOUGH OF 
THIS — JUST BECAUSE YOU’RE ALLOWED TO USE 
MAGIC NOW YOU DONT HAVE TO WHIP YOUR 
WANDS OUT FOR EVERY TINY LITTLE THING!” 

“We were just trying to save a bit of time!” said Fred, 
hurrying forward and wrenching the bread knife out 
of the table. “Sorry Sirius, mate — didn’t mean to — ” 

Harry and Sirius were both laughing. Mundungus, 
who had toppled backward off his chair, was swearing 
as he got to his feet. Crookshanks had given an angry 
hiss and shot off under the dresser, from whence his 
large yellow eyes glowed in the darkness. 

“Boys,” Mr. Weasley said, lifting the stew back into 
the middle of the table, “your mother’s right, you’re 
supposed to show a sense of responsibility now you’ve 
come of age — ” 

“ — none of your brothers caused this sort of trouble!” 
Mrs. Weasley raged at the twins, slamming a fresh 
flagon of butterbeer onto the table and spilling almost 
as much again. “Bill didn’t feel the need to Apparate 

Page | 109Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




every few feet! Charlie didn’t Charm everything he 
met! Percy — ” 

She stopped dead, catching her breath with a 
frightened look at her husband, whose expression 
was suddenly wooden. 

“Let’s eat,” said Bill quickly. 

“It looks wonderful, Molly,” said Lupin, ladling stew 
onto a plate for her and handing it across the table. 

For a few minutes there was silence but for the chink 
of plates and cutlery and the scraping of chairs as 
everyone settled down to their food. Then Mrs. 

Weasley turned to Sirius and said, “I’ve been meaning 
to tell you, there’s something trapped in that writing 
desk in the drawing room, it keeps rattling and 
shaking. Of course, it could just be a boggart, but I 
thought we ought to ask Alastor to have a look at it 
before we let it out.” 

“Whatever you like,” said Sirius indifferently. 

“The curtains in there are full of doxies too,” Mrs. 
Weasley went on. “I thought we might try and tackle 
them tomorrow.” 

“I look forward to it,” said Sirius. Harry heard the 
sarcasm in his voice, but he was not sure that anyone 
else did. 

Opposite Harry, Tonks was entertaining Hermione 
and Ginny by transforming her nose between 
mouthfuls. Screwing up her eyes each time with the 
same pained expression she had worn back in Harry’s 
bedroom, her nose swelled to a beaklike protuberance 
like Snape’s, shrank to something resembling a 
button mushroom, and then sprouted a great deal of 
Page | llOHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




hair from each nostril. Apparently this was a regular 
mealtime entertainment, because after a while 
Hermione and Ginny started requesting their favorite 
noses. 

“Do that one like a pig snout, Tonks ...” 

Tonks obliged, and Harry, looking up, had the fleeting 
impression that a female Dudley was grinning at him 
from across the table. 

Mr. Weasley, Bill, and Lupin were having an intense 
discussion about goblins. 

“They’re not giving anything away yet,” said Bill. “I 
still can’t work out whether they believe he’s back or 
not. ’Course, they might prefer not to take sides at all. 
Keep out of it.” 

“I’m sure they’d never go over to You-Know-Who,” 
said Mr. Weasley, shaking his head. “They’ve suffered 
losses too. Remember that goblin family he murdered 
last time, somewhere near Nottingham?” 

“I think it depends what they’re offered,” said Lupin. 
“And I’m not talking about gold; if they’re offered 
freedoms we’ve been denying them for centuries 
they’re going to be tempted. Have you still not had 
any luck with Ragnok, Bill?” 

“He’s feeling pretty anti-wizard at the moment,” said 
Bill. “He hasn’t stopped raging about the Bagman 
business, he reckons the Ministry did a cover-up, 
those goblins never got their gold from him, you know 



A gale of laughter from the middle of the table 
drowned the rest of Bill’s words. Fred, George, Ron, 
and Mundungus were rolling around in their seats. 

Page | lllHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




"... and then,” choked Mundungus, tears running 
down his face, “and then, if you’ll believe it, ’e says to 
me, ’e says, ‘’ere, Dung, where didja get all them toads 
from? ’Cos some son of a Bludger’s gone and nicked 
all mine!’ And I says, ‘Nicked all your toads, Will, 
what next? So you’ll be wanting some more, then?’ 
And if you’ll believe me, lads, the gormless gargoyle 
buys all ’is own toads back orf me for twice what ’e 
paid in the first place — ■” 

“I don’t think we need to hear any more of your 
business dealings, thank you very much, 
Mundungus,” said Mrs. Weasley sharply, as Ron 
slumped forward onto the table, howling with 
laughter. 

“Beg pardon, Molly,” said Mundungus at once, wiping 
his eyes and winking at Harry. “But, you know, Will 
nicked ’em orf Warty Harris in the first place so I 
wasn’t really doing nothing wrong — ” 

“I don’t know where you learned about right and 
wrong, Mundungus, but you seem to have missed a 
few crucial lessons,” said Mrs. Weasley coldly. 

Fred and George buried their faces in their goblets of 
butterbeer; George was hiccuping. For some reason, 
Mrs. Weasley threw a very nasty look at Sirius before 
getting to her feet and going to fetch a large rhubarb 
crumble for pudding. Harry looked round at his 
godfather. 

“Molly doesn’t approve of Mundungus,” said Sirius in 
an undertone. 

“How come he’s in the Order?” Harry said very 
quietly. 



Page | 112Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“He’s useful,” Sirius muttered. “Knows all the crooks 
— well, he would, seeing as he’s one himself. But he’s 
also very loyal to Dumbledore, who helped him out of 
a tight spot once. It pays to have someone like Dung 
around, he hears things we don’t. But Molly thinks 
inviting him to stay for dinner is going too far. She 
hasn’t forgiven him for slipping off duty when he was 
supposed to be tailing you.” 

Three helpings of rhubarb crumble and custard later 
and the waistband on Harry’s jeans was feeling 
uncomfortably tight (which was saying something, as 
the jeans had once been Dudley’s). He lay down his 
spoon in a lull in the general conversation. Mr. 
Weasley was leaning back in his chair, looking replete 
and relaxed, Tonks was yawning widely, her nose now 
back to normal, and Ginny, who had lured 
Crookshanks out from under the dresser, was sitting 
cross-legged on the floor, rolling butterbeer corks for 
him to chase. 

“Nearly time for bed, I think,” said Mrs. Weasley on a 
yawn. 

“Not just yet, Molly,” said Sirius, pushing away his 
empty plate and turning to look at Harry. “You know, 
I’m surprised at you. I thought the first thing you’d do 
when you got here would be to start asking questions 
about Voldemort.” 

The atmosphere in the room changed with the 
rapidity Harry associated with the arrival of 
dementors. Where seconds before it had been sleepily 
relaxed, it was now alert, even tense. A frisson had 
gone around the table at the mention of Voldemort’s 
name. Lupin, who had been about to take a sip of 
wine, lowered his goblet slowly, looking wary. 



Page | 113Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“I did!” said Harry indignantly. “I asked Ron and 
Hermione but they said we’re not allowed in the 
Order, so — ” 

“And they’re quite right,” said Mrs. Weasley. “You’re 
too young.” 

She was sitting bolt upright in her chair, her fists 
clenched upon its arms, every trace of drowsiness 
gone. 

“Since when did someone have to be in the Order of 
the Phoenix to ask questions?” asked Sirius. “Harry’s 
been trapped in that Muggle house for a month. He’s 
got the right to know what’s been happen — ” 

“Hang on!” interrupted George loudly. 

“How come Harry gets his questions answered?” said 
Fred angrily. 

“ We’ve been trying to get stuff out of you for a month 
and you haven’t told us a single stinking thing!” said 
George. 

“ ‘You’re too young, you’re not in the Order,’ ” said 
Fred, in a high-pitched voice that sounded uncannily 
like his mother’s. “Harry’s not even of age!” 

“It’s not my fault you haven’t been told what the 
Order’s doing,” said Sirius calmly. “That’s your 
parents’ decision. Harry, on the other hand — ” 

“It’s not down to you to decide what’s good for Harry!” 
said Mrs. Weasley sharply. Her normally kindly face 
looked dangerous. “You haven’t forgotten what 
Dumbledore said, I suppose?” 



Page | 114Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Which bit?” Sirius asked politely, but with an air as 
though readying himself for a fight. 

“The bit about not telling Harry more than he needs 
to know,” said Mrs. Weasley, placing a heavy 
emphasis on the last three words. 

Ron, Hermione, Fred, and George’s heads turned from 
Sirius to Mrs. Weasley as though following a tennis 
rally. Ginny was kneeling amid a pile of abandoned 
butterbeer corks, watching the conversation with her 
mouth slightly open. Lupin’s eyes were fixed on 
Sirius. 

“I don’t intend to tell him more than he needs to 
know, Molly,” said Sirius. “But as he was the one who 
saw Voldemort come back” (again, there was a 
collective shudder around the table at the name), “he 
has more right than most to — ” 

“He’s not a member of the Order of the Phoenix!” said 
Mrs. Weasley. “He’s only fifteen and — ” 

“ — and he’s dealt with as much as most in the 
Order,” said Sirius, “and more than some — ” 

“No one’s denying what he’s done!” said Mrs. Weasley, 
her voice rising, her fists trembling on the arms of her 
chair. “But he’s still — ” 

“He’s not a child!” said Sirius impatiently. 

“He’s not an adult either!” said Mrs. Weasley, the 
color rising in her cheeks. “He’s not James, Sirius!” 

“I’m perfectly clear who he is, thanks, Molly,” said 
Sirius coldly. 



Page | 115Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




‘Tm not sure you are!” said Mrs. Weasley. 

“Sometimes, the way you talk about him, it’s as 
though you think you’ve got your best friend back!” 

“What’s wrong with that?” said Harry. 

“What’s wrong, Harry, is that you are not your father, 
however much you might look like him!” said Mrs. 
Weasley, her eyes still boring into Sirius. “You are still 
at school and adults responsible for you should not 
forget it!” 

“Meaning I’m an irresponsible godfather?” demanded 
Sirius, his voice rising. 

“Meaning you’ve been known to act rashly, Sirius, 
which is why Dumbledore keeps reminding you to 
stay at home and — ” 

“We’ll leave my instructions from Dumbledore out of 
this, if you please!” said Sirius loudly. 

“Arthur!” said Mrs. Weasley, rounding on her 
husband. “Arthur, back me up!” 

Mr. Weasley did not speak at once. He took off his 
glasses and cleaned them slowly on his robes, not 
looking at his wife. Only when he had replaced them 
carefully on his nose did he say, “Dumbledore knows 
the position has changed, Molly. He accepts that 
Harry will have to be filled in to a certain extent now 
that he is staying at headquarters — ” 

“Yes, but there’s a difference between that and 
inviting him to ask whatever he likes!” 

“Personally,” said Lupin quietly, looking away from 
Sirius at last, as Mrs. Weasley turned quickly to him, 
hopeful that finally she was about to get an ally, “I 

Page | 116Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




think it better that Harry gets the facts — not all the 
facts, Molly, but the general picture — from us, rather 
than a garbled version from ... others.” 

His expression was mild, but Harry felt sure that 
Lupin, at least, knew that some Extendable Ears had 
survived Mrs. Weasley’s purge. 

“Well,” said Mrs. Weasley, breathing deeply and 
looking around the table for support that did not 
come, “well ... I can see I’m going to be overruled. I’ll 
just say this: Dumbledore must have had his reasons 
for not wanting Harry to know too much, and 
speaking as someone who has got Harry’s best 
interests at heart — ” 

“He’s not your son,” said Sirius quietly. 

“He’s as good as,” said Mrs. Weasley fiercely. “Who 
else has he got?” 

“He’s got me!” 

“Yes,” said Mrs. Weasley, her lip curling. “The thing 
is, it’s been rather difficult for you to look after him 
while you’ve been locked up in Azkaban, hasn’t it?” 

Sirius started to rise from his chair. 

“Molly, you’re not the only person at this table who 
cares about Harry,” said Lupin sharply. “Sirius, sit 
down.” 

Mrs. Weasley’s lower lip was trembling. Sirius sank 
slowly back into his chair, his face white. 

“I think Harry ought to be allowed a say in this,” 

Lupin continued. “He’s old enough to decide for 
himself.” 

Page | 117Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“I want to know what’s been going on,” Harry said at 
once. 

He did not look at Mrs. Weasley. He had been touched 
by what she had said about his being as good as a 
son, but he was also impatient at her mollycoddling. . . 
Sirius was right, he was not a child. 

“Very well,” said Mrs. Weasley, her voice cracking. 
“Ginny — Ron — Hermione — Fred — George — I 
want you out of this kitchen, now.” 

There was instant uproar. 

“We’re of age!” Fred and George bellowed together. 

“If Harry’s allowed, why can’t I?” shouted Ron. 

“Mum, I want to!” wailed Ginny. 

“NO!” shouted Mrs. Weasley, standing up, her eyes 
overbright. “I absolutely forbid — ” 

“Molly, you can’t stop Fred and George,” said Mr. 
Weasley wearily. “They are of age — ” 

“They’re still at school — ” 

“But they’re legally adults now,” said Mr. Weasley in 
the same tired voice. 

Mrs. Weasley was now scarlet in the face. 

“I — oh, all right then, Fred and George can stay, but 
Ron — ” 

“Harry’ll tell me and Hermione everything you say 
anyway!” said Ron hotly. “Won’t — won’t you?” he 
added uncertainly, meeting Harry’s eyes. 

Page | 118Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




For a split second, Harry considered telling Ron that 
he wouldn’t tell him a single word, that he could try a 
taste of being kept in the dark and see how he liked 
it. But the nasty impulse vanished as they looked at 
each other. 

“ ’Course I will,” Harry said. Ron and Hermione 
beamed. 

“Fine!” shouted Mrs. Weasley. “Fine! Ginny — BED!” 

Ginny did not go quietly. They could hear her raging 
and storming at her mother all the way up the stairs, 
and when she reached the hall Mrs. Black’s 
earsplitting shrieks were added to the din. Lupin 
hurried off to the portrait to restore calm. It was only 
after he had returned, closing the kitchen door 
behind him and taking his seat at the table again, 
that Sirius spoke. 

“Okay, Harry ... what do you want to know?” 

Harry took a deep breath and asked the question that 
had been obsessing him for a month. 

“Where’s Voldemort? What’s he doing? I’ve been trying 
to watch the Muggle news,” he said, ignoring the 
renewed shudders and winces at the name, “and 
there hasn’t been anything that looks like him yet, no 
funny deaths or anything — ” 

“That’s because there haven’t been any suspicious 
deaths yet,” said Sirius, “not as far as we know, 
anyway... And we know quite a lot.” 

“More than he thinks we do anyway,” said Lupin.

“How come he’s stopped killing people?” Harry asked. 
He knew that Voldemort had murdered more than 
once in the last year alone. 

“Because he doesn’t want to draw attention to himself 
at the moment,” said Sirius. “It would be dangerous 
for him. His comeback didn’t come off quite the way 
he wanted it to, you see. He messed it up.” 

“Or rather, you messed it up for him,” said Lupin with 
a satisfied smile. 

“How?” Harry asked perplexedly. 

“You weren’t supposed to survive!” said Sirius. 
“Nobody apart from his Death Eaters was supposed to 
know he’d come back. But you survived to bear 
witness.” 

“And the very last person he wanted alerted to his 
return the moment he got back was Dumbledore,” 
said Lupin. “And you made sure Dumbledore knew at 
once.” 

“How has that helped?” Harry asked. 

“Are you kidding?” said Bill incredulously. 
“Dumbledore was the only one You-Know-Who was 
ever scared of!” 

“Thanks to you, Dumbledore was able to recall the 
Order of the Phoenix about an hour after Voldemort 
returned,” said Sirius. 

“So what’s the Order been doing?” said Harry, looking 
around at them all. 

“Working as hard as we can to make sure Voldemort 
can’t carry out his plans,” said Sirius. 

Page | 120Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“How d’you know what his plans are?” Harry asked 
quickly. 



“Dumbledore’s got a shrewd idea,” said Lupin, “and 
Dumbledore’s shrewd ideas normally turn out to be 
accurate.” 

“So what does Dumbledore reckon he’s planning?” 

“Well, firstly, he wants to build up his army again,” 
said Sirius. “In the old days he had huge numbers at 
his command; witches and wizards he’d bullied or 
bewitched into following him, his faithful Death 
Eaters, a great variety of Dark creatures. You heard 
him planning to recruit the giants; well, they’ll be just 
one group he’s after. He’s certainly not going to try 
and take on the Ministry of Magic with only a dozen 
Death Eaters.” 

“So you’re trying to stop him getting more followers?” 
“We’re doing our best,” said Lupin. 

“How?” 

“Well, the main thing is to try and convince as many 
people as possible that You-Know-Who really has 
returned, to put them on their guard,” said Bill. “It’s 
proving tricky, though.” 

“Why?” 

“Because of the Ministry’s attitude,” said Tonks. “You 
saw Cornelius Fudge after You-Know-Who came back, 
Harry. Well, he hasn’t shifted his position at all. He’s 
absolutely refusing to believe it’s happened.” 

“But why?” said Harry desperately. “Why’s he being 
so stupid? If Dumbledore — ” 

Page | 121Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Ah, well, you’ve put your finger on the problem,” said 
Mr. Weasley with a wry smile. “Dumbledore.” 

“Fudge is frightened of him, you see,” said Tonks 
sadly. 

“Frightened of Dumbledore?” said Harry 
incredulously. 

“Frightened of what he’s up to,” said Mr. Weasley. 
“You see, Fudge thinks Dumbledore’s plotting to 
overthrow him. He thinks Dumbledore wants to be 
Minister of Magic.” 

“But Dumbledore doesn’t want — ” 

“Of course he doesn’t,” said Mr. Weasley. “He’s never 
wanted the Minister’s job, even though a lot of people 
wanted him to take it when Millicent Bagnold retired. 
Fudge came to power instead, but he’s never quite 
forgotten how much popular support Dumbledore 
had, even though Dumbledore never applied for the 
job.” 

“Deep down, Fudge knows Dumbledore’s much 
cleverer than he is, a much more powerful wizard, 
and in the early days of his Ministry he was forever 
asking Dumbledore for help and advice,” said Lupin. 
“But it seems that he’s become fond of power now, 
and much more confident. He loves being Minister of 
Magic, and he’s managed to convince himself that 
he’s the clever one and Dumbledore’s simply stirring 
up trouble for the sake of it.” 

“How can he think that?” said Harry angrily. “How 
can he think Dumbledore would just make it all up — 
that I’d make it all up?” 



Page | 122Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Because accepting that Voldemort’s back would 
mean trouble like the Ministry hasn’t had to cope 
with for nearly fourteen years,” said Sirius bitterly. 
“Fudge just can’t bring himself to face it. It’s so much 
more comfortable to convince himself Dumbledore’s 
lying to destabilize him.” 

“You see the problem,” said Lupin. “While the 
Ministry insists there is nothing to fear from 
Voldemort, it’s hard to convince people he’s back, 
especially as they really don’t want to believe it in the 
first place. What’s more, the Ministry’s leaning heavily 
on the Daily Prophet not to report any of what they’re 
calling Dumbledore’s rumormongering, so most of the 
Wizarding community are completely unaware 
anything’s happened, and that makes them easy 
targets for the Death Eaters if they’re using the 
Imperius Curse.” 

“But you’re telling people, aren’t you?” said Harry, 
looking around at Mr. Weasley, Sirius, Bill, 
Mundungus, Lupin, and Tonks. “You’re letting people 
know he’s back?” 

They all smiled humorlessly. 

“Well, as everyone thinks I’m a mad mass murderer 
and the Ministry’s put a ten-thousand-Galleon price 
on my head, I can hardly stroll up the street and start 
handing out leaflets, can I?” said Sirius restlessly. 

“And I’m not a very popular dinner guest with most of 
the community,” said Lupin. “It’s an occupational 
hazard of being a werewolf.” 

“Tonks and Arthur would lose their jobs at the 
Ministry if they started shooting their mouths off,” 
said Sirius, “and it’s very important for us to have 



Page | 123Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




spies inside the Ministry, because you can bet 
Voldemort will have them.” 

“We’ve managed to convince a couple of people, 
though,” said Mr. Weasley. “Tonks here, for one — 
she’s too young to have been in the Order of the 
Phoenix last time, and having Aurors on our side is a 
huge advantage — Kingsley Shacklebolt’s been a real 
asset too. He’s in charge of the hunt for Sirius, so he’s 
been feeding the Ministry information that Sirius is in 
Tibet.” 

“But if none of you’s putting the news out that 
Voldemort ’s back — ” Harry began. 

“Who said none of us was putting the news out?” said 
Sirius. “Why d’you think Dumbledore’s in such 
trouble?” 

“What d’you mean?” Harry asked. 

“They’re trying to discredit him,” said Lupin. “Didn’t 
you see the Daily Prophet last week? They reported 
that he’d been voted out of the Chairmanship of the 
International Confederation of Wizards because he’s 
getting old and losing his grip, but it’s not true, he 
was voted out by Ministry wizards after he made a 
speech announcing Voldemort’s return. They’ve 
demoted him from Chief Warlock on the Wizengamot 
— that’s the Wizard High Court — and they’re talking 
about taking away his Order of Merlin, First Class, 
too.” 

“But Dumbledore says he doesn’t care what they do 
as long as they don’t take him off the Chocolate Frog 
cards,” said Bill, grinning. 

“It’s no laughing matter,” said Mr. Weasley shortly. “If 
he carries on defying the Ministry like this, he could 

Page | 124Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




end up in Azkaban and the last thing we want is 
Dumbledore locked up. While You-Know-Who knows 
Dumbledore’s out there and wise to what he’s up to, 
he’s going to go cautiously for a while. If 
Dumbledore’s out of the way — well, You-Know-Who 
will have a clear field.” 

“But if Voldemort’s trying to recruit more Death 
Eaters, it’s bound to get out that he’s come back, isn’t 
it?” asked Harry desperately. 

“Voldemort doesn’t march up to people’s houses and 
bang on their front doors, Harry,” said Sirius. “He 
tricks, jinxes, and blackmails them. He’s well- 
practiced at operating in secrecy. In any case, 
gathering followers is only one thing he’s interested 
in, he’s got other plans too, plans he can put into 
operation very quietly indeed, and he’s concentrating 
on them at the moment.” 

“What’s he after apart from followers?” Harry asked 
swiftly. 

He thought he saw Sirius and Lupin exchange the 
most fleeting of looks before Sirius said, “Stuff he can 
only get by stealth.” 

When Harry continued to look puzzled, Sirius said, 
“Like a weapon. Something he didn’t have last time.” 

“When he was powerful before?” 

“Yes.” 

“Like what kind of weapon?” said Harry. “Something 
worse than the Avada Kedavra — ?” 

“That’s enough.” 



Page | 125Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Mrs. Weasley spoke from the shadows beside the 
door. Harry had not noticed her return from taking 
Ginny upstairs. Her arms were crossed and she 
looked furious. 

“I want you in bed, now. All of you,” she added, 
looking around at Fred, George, Ron, and Hermione. 

“You can’t boss us — ” Fred began. 

“Watch me,” snarled Mrs. Weasley. She was trembling 
slightly as she looked at Sirius. “You’ve given Harry 
plenty of information. Any more and you might just 
as well induct him into the Order straightaway.” 

“Why not?” said Harry quickly. “I’ll join, I want to join, 
I want to fight — ” 

“No.” 

It was not Mrs. Weasley who spoke this time, but 
Lupin. 

“The Order is comprised only of overage wizards,” he 
said. “Wizards who have left school,” he added, as 
Fred and George opened their mouths. “There are 
dangers involved of which you can have no idea, any 
of you ... I think Molly’s right, Sirius. We’ve said 
enough.” 

Sirius half-shrugged but did not argue. Mrs. Weasley 
beckoned imperiously to her sons and Hermione. One 
by one they stood up and Harry, recognizing defeat, 
followed suit. 



Page | 126Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 







THE NOBLE AND MOST ANCIENT 
HOUSE OF BLACK 

Mrs. Weasley followed them upstairs looking grim. 

“I want you all to go straight to bed, no talking,” she 
said as they reached the first landing. “We’ve got a 
busy day tomorrow. I expect Ginny’s asleep,” she 
added to Hermione, “so try not to wake her up.” 

“Asleep, yeah, right,” said Fred in an undertone, after 
Hermione bade them good night and they were 
climbing to the next floor. “If Ginny’s not lying awake 
waiting for Hermione to tell her everything they said 
downstairs, then I’m a flobberworm...” 

“All right, Ron, Harry,” said Mrs. Weasley on the 
second landing, pointing them into their bedroom. 

“Off to bed with you.” 

“ ’Night,” Harry and Ron said to the twins. 

“Sleep tight,” said Fred, winking. 

Page | 127Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 



Mrs. Weasley closed the door behind Harry with a 
sharp snap. The bedroom looked, if anything, even 
danker and gloomier than it had on first sight. The 
blank picture on the wall was now breathing very 
slowly and deeply, as though its invisible occupant 
was asleep. Harry put on his pajamas, took off his 
glasses, and climbed into his chilly bed while Ron 
threw Owl Treats up on top of the wardrobe to pacify 
Hedwig and Pigwidgeon, who were clattering around 
and rustling their wings restlessly. 

“We can’t let them out to hunt every night,” Ron 
explained as he pulled on his maroon pajamas. 
“Dumbledore doesn’t want too many owls swooping 
around the square, thinks it’ll look suspicious. Oh 
yeah ... I forgot...” 

He crossed to the door and bolted it. 

“What ’re you doing that for?” 

“Kreacher,” said Ron as he turned off the light. “First 
night I was here he came wandering in at three in the 
morning. Trust me, you don’t want to wake up and 
find him prowling around your room. Anyway ...” He 
got into his bed, settled down under the covers, then 
turned to look at Harry in the darkness. Harry could 
see his outline by the moonlight filtering in through 
the grimy window. “What d’you reckon?” 

Harry didn’t need to ask what Ron meant. 

“Well, they didn’t tell us much we couldn’t have 
guessed, did they?” he said, thinking of all that had 
been said downstairs. “I mean, all they’ve really said 
is that the Order’s trying to stop people joining Vol — ” 

There was a sharp intake of breath from Ron. 



Page | 128Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“ — demort” said Harry firmly. “When are you going to 
start using his name? Sirius and Lupin do.” 



Ron ignored this last comment. “Yeah, you’re right,” 
he said. “We already knew nearly everything they told 
us, from using the Extendable Ears. The only new bit 
was — ” 

Crack. 

“OUCH!” 

“Keep your voice down, Ron, or Mum’ll be back up 
here.” 

“You two just Apparated on my knees!” 

“Yeah, well, it’s harder in the dark — ” 

Harry saw the blurred outlines of Fred and George 
leaping down from Ron’s bed. There was a groan of 
bedsprings and Harry’s mattress descended a few 
inches as George sat down near his feet. 

“So, got there yet?” said George eagerly. 

“The weapon Sirius mentioned?” said Harry. 

“Let slip, more like,” said Fred with relish, now sitting 
next to Ron. “We didn’t hear about that on the old 
Extendables, did we?” 

“What d’you reckon it is?” said Harry. 

“Could be anything,” said Fred. 

“But there can’t be anything worse than the Avada 
Kedavra curse, can there?” said Ron. “What’s worse 
than death?” 

Page | 129Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Maybe it’s something that can kill loads of people at 
once,” suggested George. 

“Maybe it’s some particularly painful way of killing 
people,” said Ron fearfully. 

“He’s got the Cruciatus Curse for causing pain,” said 
Harry. “He doesn’t need anything more efficient than 
that.” 

There was a pause and Harry knew that the others, 
like him, were wondering what horrors this weapon 
could perpetrate. 

“So who d’you thinks got it now?” asked George. 

“I hope it’s our side,” said Ron, sounding slightly 
nervous. 

“If it is, Dumbledore’s probably keeping it,” said Fred. 

“Where?” said Ron quickly. “Hogwarts?” 

“Bet it is!” said George. “That’s where he hid the 
Sorcerer’s Stone!” 

“A weapon’s going to be a lot bigger than the Stone, 
though!” said Ron. 

“Not necessarily,” said Fred. 

“Yeah, size is no guarantee of power,” said George. 
“Look at Ginny.” 

“What d’you mean?” said Harry. 

“You’ve never been on the receiving end of one of her 
Bat-Bogey Hexes, have you?” 



Page | 130Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Shhh!” said Fred, half-rising from the bed. “Listen!” 



They fell silent. Footsteps were coming up the stairs 
again. 

“Mum,” said George, and without further ado there 
was a loud crack and Harry felt the weight vanish 
from the end of his bed. A few seconds later and they 
heard the floorboard creak outside their door; Mrs. 
Weasley was plainly listening to see whether they 
were talking or not. 

Hedwig and Pigwidgeon hooted dolefully. The 
floorboard creaked again and they heard her heading 
upstairs to check on Fred and George. 

“She doesn’t trust us at all, you know,” said Ron 
regretfully. 

Harry was sure he would not be able to fall asleep; 
the evening had been so packed with things to think 
about that he fully expected to lie awake for hours 
mulling it all over. He wanted to continue talking to 
Ron, but Mrs. Weasley was now creaking back 
downstairs again, and once she had gone he distinctly 
heard others making their way upstairs... In fact, 
many-legged creatures were cantering softly up and 
down outside the bedroom door, and Hagrid, the Care 
of Magical Creatures teacher, was saying, “Beauties, 
aren’ they, eh, Harry? We’ll be study in’ weapons this 
term...” And Harry saw that the creatures had 
cannons for heads and were wheeling to face him... 

He ducked... 

The next thing he knew, he was curled in a warm ball 
under his bedclothes, and George’s loud voice was 
filling the room. 



Page | 131Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Mum says get up, your breakfast is in the kitchen 
and then she needs you in the drawing room, there 
are loads more doxies than she thought and she’s 
found a nest of dead puffskeins under the sofa.” 

Half an hour later, Harry and Ron, who had dressed 
and breakfasted quickly, entered the drawing room, a 
long, high-ceilinged room on the first floor with olive- 
green walls covered in dirty tapestries. The carpet 
exhaled little clouds of dust every time someone put 
their foot on it and the long, moss-green velvet 
curtains were buzzing as though swarming with 
invisible bees. It was around these that Mrs. Weasley, 
Hermione, Ginny, Fred, and George were grouped, all 
looking rather peculiar, as they had tied cloths over 
their noses and mouths. Each of them was also 
holding a large bottle of black liquid with a nozzle at 
the end. 

“Cover your faces and take a spray,” Mrs. Weasley 
said to Harry and Ron the moment she saw them, 
pointing to two more bottles of black liquid standing 
on a spindle-legged table. “It’s Doxycide. I’ve never 
seen an infestation this bad — what that house-elf’s 
been doing for the last ten years — ” 

Hermione ’s face was half concealed by a tea towel but 
Harry distinctly saw her throw a reproachful look at 
Mrs. Weasley at these words. 

“Kreacher’s really old, he probably couldn’t manage — 



“You’d be surprised what Kreacher can manage when 
he wants to, Hermione,” said Sirius, who had just 
entered the room carrying a bloodstained bag of what 
appeared to be dead rats. “I’ve just been feeding 
Buckbeak,” he added, in reply to Harry’s inquiring 



Page | 132Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




look. “I keep him upstairs in my mother’s bedroom. 
Anyway ... this writing desk ...” 

He dropped the bag of rats onto an armchair, then 
bent over to examine the locked cabinet which, Harry 
now noticed for the first time, was shaking slightly. 

“Well, Molly, I’m pretty sure this is a boggart,” said 
Sirius, peering through the keyhole, “but perhaps we 
ought to let Mad-Eye have a shifty at it before we let it 
out — knowing my mother it could be something 
much worse.” 

“Right you are, Sirius,” said Mrs. Weasley. 

They were both speaking in carefully light, polite 
voices that told Harry quite plainly that neither had 
forgotten their disagreement of the night before. 

A loud, clanging bell sounded from downstairs, 
followed at once by the cacophony of screams and 
wails that had been triggered the previous night by 
Tonks knocking over the umbrella stand. 

“I keep telling them not to ring the doorbell!” said 
Sirius exasperatedly, hurrying back out of the room. 
They heard him thundering down the stairs as Mrs. 
Black’s screeches echoed up through the house once 
more: “Stains of dishonor, filthy half-breeds, blood 
traitors, children of filth ...” 

“Close the door, please, Harry,” said Mrs. Weasley. 

Harry took as much time as he dared to close the 
drawing room door; he wanted to listen to what was 
going on downstairs. Sirius had obviously managed to 
shut the curtains over his mother’s portrait because 
she had stopped screaming. He heard Sirius walking 
down the hall, then the clattering of the chain on the 
Page | 133Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




front door, and then a deep voice he recognized as 
Kingsley Shacklebolt’s saying, “Hestia’s just relieved 
me, so she’s got Moody’s cloak now, thought I’d leave 
a report for Dumbledore...” 

Feeling Mrs. Weasley’s eyes on the back of his head, 
Harry regretfully closed the drawing room door and 
rejoined the doxy party. 

Mrs. Weasley was bending over to check the page on 
doxies in Gilderoy Lockhart’s Guide to Household 
Pests, which was lying open on the sofa. 

“Right, you lot, you need to be careful, because doxies 
bite and their teeth are poisonous. I’ve got a bottle of 
antidote here, but I’d rather nobody needed it.” 

She straightened up, positioned herself squarely in 
front of the curtains, and beckoned them all forward. 

“When I say the word, start spraying immediately,” 
she said. “They’ll come flying out at us, I expect, but it 
says on the sprays one good squirt will paralyze them. 
When they’re immobilized, just throw them in this 
bucket.” 

She stepped carefully out of their line of fire and 
raised her own spray. “All right — squirti” 

Harry had been spraying only a few seconds when a 
fully grown doxy came soaring out of a fold in the 
material, shiny beetlelike wings whirring, tiny needle- 
sharp teeth bared, its fairylike body covered with 
thick black hair and its four tiny fists clenched with 
fury. Harry caught it full in the face with a blast of 
Doxycide; it froze in midair and fell, with a 
surprisingly loud thunk, onto the worn carpet below. 
Harry picked it up and threw it in the bucket. 



Page | 134Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Fred, what are you doing?” said Mrs. Weasley 
sharply. “Spray that at once and throw it away!” 

Harry looked around. Fred was holding a struggling 
doxy between his forefinger and thumb. 

“Right-o,” Fred said brightly, spraying the doxy 
quickly in the face so that it fainted, but the moment 
Mrs. Weasley’s back was turned he pocketed it with a 
wink. 

“We want to experiment with doxy venom for our 
Skiving Snack-boxes,” George told Harry under his 
breath. 

Deftly spraying two doxies at once as they soared 
straight for his nose, Harry moved closer to George 
and muttered out of the corner of his mouth, “What 
are Skiving Snackboxes?” 

“Range of sweets to make you ill,” George whispered, 
keeping a wary eye on Mrs. Weasley’s back. “Not 
seriously ill, mind, just ill enough to get you out of a 
class when you feel like it. Fred and I have been 
developing them this summer. They’re double-ended, 
color-coded chews. If you eat the orange half of the 
Puking Pastilles, you throw up. Moment you’ve been 
rushed out of the lesson for the hospital wing, you 
swallow the purple half — ” 

“ ‘ — which restores you to full fitness, enabling you to 
pursue the leisure activity of your own choice during 
an hour that would otherwise have been devoted to 
unprofitable boredom.’ That’s what we’re putting in 
the adverts, anyway,” whispered Fred, who had edged 
over out of Mrs. Weasley’s line of vision and was now 
sweeping a few stray doxies from the floor and adding 
them to his pocket. “But they still need a bit of work. 
At the moment our testers are having a bit of trouble 
Page | 135Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




stopping puking long enough to swallow the purple 
end.” 



“Testers?” 

“Us,” said Fred. “We take it in turns. George did the 
Fainting Fancies — we both tried the Nosebleed 
Nougat — ” 

“Mum thought we’d been dueling,” said George. 

“Joke shop still on, then?” Harry muttered, 
pretending to be adjusting the nozzle on his spray. 

“Well, we haven’t had a chance to get premises yet,” 
said Fred, dropping his voice even lower as Mrs. 
Weasley mopped her brow with her scarf before 
returning to the attack, “so we’re running it as a mail- 
order service at the moment. We put advertisements 
in the Daily Prophet last week.” 

“All thanks to you, mate,” said George. “But don’t 
worry ... Mum hasn’t got a clue. She won’t read the 
Daily Prophet anymore, ’cause of it telling lies about 
you and Dumbledore.” 

Harry grinned. He had forced the Weasley twins to 
take the thousand-Galleon prize money he had won 
in the Triwizard Tournament to help them realize 
their ambition to open a joke shop, but he was still 
glad to know that his part in furthering their plans 
was unknown to Mrs. Weasley, who did not think that 
running a joke shop was a suitable career for two of 
her sons. 

The de-doxying of the curtains took most of the 
morning. It was past midday when Mrs. Weasley 
finally removed her protective scarf, sank into a 
sagging armchair, and sprang up again with a cry of 

Page | 136Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




disgust, having sat on the bag of dead rats. The 
curtains were no longer buzzing; they hung limp and 
damp from the intensive spraying; unconscious 
doxies lay crammed in the bucket at the foot of them 
beside a bowl of their black eggs, at which 
Crookshanks was now sniffing and Fred and George 
were shooting covetous looks. 

“I think well tackle those after lunch.” 

Mrs. Weasley pointed at the dusty glass-fronted 
cabinets standing on either side of the mantelpiece. 
They were crammed with an odd assortment of 
objects: a selection of rusty daggers, claws, a coiled 
snakeskin, a number of tarnished silver boxes 
inscribed with languages Harry could not understand 
and, least pleasant of all, an ornate crystal bottle with 
a large opal set into the stopper, full of what Harry 
was quite sure was blood. 

The clanging doorbell rang again. Everyone looked at 
Mrs. Weasley. 

“Stay here,” she said firmly, snatching up the bag of 
rats as Mrs. Blacks screeches started up again from 
down below. “I’ll bring up some sandwiches.” 

She left the room, closing the door carefully behind 
her. At once, everyone dashed over to the window to 
look down onto the doorstep. They could see the top 
of an unkempt gingery head and a stack of 
precariously balanced cauldrons. 

“Mundungus!” said Hermione. “What’s he brought all 
those cauldrons for?” 

“Probably looking for a safe place to keep them,” said 
Harry. “Isn’t that what he was doing the night he was 



Page | 137Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




supposed to be tailing me? Picking up dodgy 
cauldrons?” 



“Yeah, you’re right!” said Fred, as the front door 
opened; Mundungus heaved his cauldrons through it 
and disappeared from view. “Blimey, Mum won’t like 
that...” 

He and George crossed to the door and stood beside 
it, listening intently. Mrs. Black’s screaming had 
stopped again. 

“Mundungus is talking to Sirius and Kingsley,” Fred 
muttered, frowning with concentration. “Can’t hear 
properly ... d’you reckon we can risk the Extendable 
Ears?” 

“Might be worth it,” said George. “I could sneak 
upstairs and get a pair — ” 

But at that precise moment there was an explosion of 
sound from downstairs that rendered Extendable 
Ears quite unnecessary. All of them could hear 
exactly what Mrs. Weasley was shouting at the top of 
her voice. 

“WE ARE NOT RUNNING A HIDEOUT FOR STOLEN 
GOODS!” 

“I love hearing Mum shouting at someone else,” said 
Fred, with a satisfied smile on his face as he opened 
the door an inch or so to allow Mrs. Weasley ’s voice to 
permeate the room better. “It makes such a nice 
change.” 

COMPLETELY IRRESPONSIBLE, AS IF WE 
HAVENT GOT ENOUGH TO WORRY ABOUT 
WITHOUT YOU DRAGGING STOLEN CAULDRONS 
INTO THE HOUSE — ” 

Page | 138Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“The idiots are letting her get into her stride,” said 
George, shaking his head. “You’ve got to head her off 
early, otherwise she builds up a head of steam and 
goes on for hours. And she’s been dying to have a go 
at Mundungus ever since he sneaked off when he was 
supposed to be following you, Harry — and there goes 
Sirius’s mum again — ” 

Mrs. Weasley’s voice was lost amid fresh shrieks and 
screams from the portraits in the hall. George made 
to shut the door to drown the noise, but before he 
could do so, a house-elf edged into the room. 

Except for the filthy rag tied like a loincloth around 
its middle, it was completely naked. It looked very old. 
Its skin seemed to be several times too big for it and 
though it was bald like all house-elves, there was a 
quantity of white hair growing out of its large, batlike 
ears. Its eyes were a bloodshot and watery gray, and 
its fleshy nose was large and rather snoutlike. 

The elf took absolutely no notice of Harry and the 
rest. Acting as though it could not see them, it 
shuffled hunchbacked, slowly and doggedly, toward 
the far end of the room, muttering under its breath all 
the while in a hoarse, deep voice like a bullfrog’s, "... 
Smells like a drain and a criminal to boot, but she’s 
no better, nasty old blood traitor with her brats 
messing up my Mistress’s house, oh my poor 
Mistress, if she knew, if she knew the scum they’ve let 
in her house, what would she say to old Kreacher, oh 
the shame of it, Mudbloods and werewolves and 
traitors and thieves, poor old Kreacher, what can he 
do...” 

“Hello, Kreacher,” said Fred very loudly, closing the 
door with a snap. 



Page | 139Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




The house-elf froze in his tracks, stopped muttering, 
and then gave a very pronounced and very 
unconvincing start of surprise. 

“Kreacher did not see Young Master,” he said, turning 
around and bowing to Fred. Still facing the carpet, he 
added, perfectly audibly, “Nasty little brat of a blood 
traitor it is.” 

“Sorry?” said George. “Didn’t catch that last bit.” 

“Kreacher said nothing,” said the elf, with a second 
bow to George, adding in a clear undertone, “and 
there’s its twin, unnatural little beasts they are.” 

Harry didn’t know whether to laugh or not. The elf 
straightened up, eyeing them all very malevolently, 
and apparently convinced that they could not hear 
him as he continued to mutter. 

"... and there’s the Mudblood, standing there bold as 
brass, oh if my Mistress knew, oh how she’d cry, and 
there’s a new boy, Kreacher doesn’t know his name, 
what is he doing here, Kreacher doesn’t know ...” 

“This is Harry, Kreacher,” said Hermione tentatively. 
“Harry Potter.” 

Kreacher’s pale eyes widened and he muttered faster 
and more furiously than ever. 

“The Mudblood is talking to Kreacher as though she 
is my friend, if Kreacher’s Mistress saw him in such 
company, oh what would she say — ” 

“Don’t call her a Mudblood!” said Ron and Ginny 
together, very angrily. 



Page | 140Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“It doesn’t matter,” Hermione whispered, “he’s not in 
his right mind, he doesn’t know what he’s — ” 

“Don’t kid yourself, Hermione, he knows exactly what 
he’s saying,” said Fred, eyeing Kreacher with great 
dislike. 

Kreacher was still muttering, his eyes on Harry. 

“Is it true? Is it Harry Potter? Kreacher can see the 
scar, it must be true, that’s that boy who stopped the 
Dark Lord, Kreacher wonders how he did it — ” 

“Don’t we all, Kreacher?” said Fred. 

“What do you want anyway?” George asked. 

Kreacher ’s huge eyes darted onto George. 

“Kreacher is cleaning,” he said evasively. 

“A likely story,” said a voice behind Harry. 

Sirius had come back; he was glowering at the elf 
from the doorway. The noise in the hall had abated; 
perhaps Mrs. Weasley and Mundungus had moved 
their argument down into the kitchen. At the sight of 
Sirius, Kreacher flung himself into a ridiculously low 
bow that flattened his snoutlike nose on the floor. 

“Stand up straight,” said Sirius impatiently. “Now, 
what are you up to?” 

“Kreacher is cleaning,” the elf repeated. “Kreacher 
lives to serve the noble house of Black — ” 

“ — and it’s getting blacker every day, it’s filthy,” said 
Sirius. 



Page | 141Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Master always liked his little joke,” said Kreacher, 
bowing again, and continuing in an undertone, 
“Master was a nasty ungrateful swine who broke his 
mother’s heart — ” 

“My mother didn’t have a heart, Kreacher,” Sirius 
snapped. “She kept herself alive out of pure spite.” 

Kreacher bowed again and said, “Whatever Master 
says,” then muttered furiously, “Master is not fit to 
wipe slime from his mother’s boots, oh my poor 
Mistress, what would she say if she saw Kreacher 
serving him, how she hated him, what a 
disappointment he was — ” 

“I asked you what you were up to,” said Sirius coldly. 
“Every time you show up pretending to be cleaning, 
you sneak something off to your room so we can’t 
throw it out.” 

“Kreacher would never move anything from its proper 
place in Master’s house,” said the elf, then muttered 
very fast, “Mistress would never forgive Kreacher if 
the tapestry was thrown out, seven centuries it’s been 
in the family, Kreacher must save it, Kreacher will not 
let Master and the blood traitors and the brats 
destroy it — ” 

“I thought it might be that,” said Sirius, casting a 
disdainful look at the opposite wall. “She’ll have put 
another Permanent Sticking Charm on the back of it, 

I don’t doubt, but if I can get rid of it I certainly will. 
Now go away, Kreacher.” 

It seemed that Kreacher did not dare disobey a direct 
order; nevertheless, the look he gave Sirius as he 
shuffled out past him was redolent of deepest loathing 
and he muttered all the way out of the room. 



Page | 142Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“ — comes back from Azkaban ordering Kreacher 
around, oh my poor Mistress, what would she say if 
she saw the house now, scum living in it, her 
treasures thrown out, she swore he was no son of 
hers and he’s back, they say he’s a murderer too — ” 

“Keep muttering and I will be a murderer!” said Sirius 
irritably, and he slammed the door shut on the elf. 

“Sirius, he’s not right in the head,” said Hermione 
pleadingly, “I don’t think he realizes we can hear 
him.” 

“He’s been alone too long,” said Sirius, “taking mad 
orders from my mother’s portrait and talking to 
himself, but he was always a foul little — ” 

“If you just set him free,” said Hermione hopefully, 
“maybe — ” 

“We can’t set him free, he knows too much about the 
Order,” said Sirius curtly. “And anyway, the shock 
would kill him. You suggest to him that he leaves this 
house, see how he takes it.” 

Sirius walked across the room, where the tapestry 
Kreacher had been trying to protect hung the length 
of the wall. Harry and the others followed. 

The tapestry looked immensely old; it was faded and 
looked as though doxies had gnawed it in places; 
nevertheless, the golden thread with which it was 
embroidered still glinted brightly enough to show 
them a sprawling family tree dating back (as far as 
Harry could tell) to the Middle Ages. Large words at 
the very top of the tapestry read: 

THE NOBLE AND MOST ANCIENT HOUSE OF BLACK 



Page | 143Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“TOUJOURS PUR” 



“You’re not on here!” said Harry, after scanning the 
bottom of the tree. 

“I used to be there,” said Sirius, pointing at a small, 
round, charred hole in the tapestry, rather like a 
cigarette burn. “My sweet old mother blasted me off 
after I ran away from home — Kreacher’s quite fond of 
muttering the story under his breath.” 

“You ran away from home?” 

“When I was about sixteen,” said Sirius. “I’d had 
enough.” 

“Where did you go?” asked Harry, staring at him. 

“Your dad’s place,” said Sirius. “Your grandparents 
were really good about it; they sort of adopted me as a 
second son. Yeah, I camped out at your dad’s during 
the school holidays, and then when I was seventeen I 
got a place of my own, my Uncle Alphard had left me 
a decent bit of gold — he’s been wiped off here too, 
that’s probably why — anyway, after that I looked 
after myself. I was always welcome at Mr. and Mrs. 
Potter’s for Sunday lunch, though.” 

“But . . . why did you ... ?” 

“Leave?” Sirius smiled bitterly and ran a hand 
through his long, unkempt hair. “Because I hated the 
whole lot of them: my parents, with their pure-blood 
mania, convinced that to be a Black made you 
practically royal . . . my idiot brother, soft enough to 
believe them ... that’s him.” 



Page | 144Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Sirius jabbed a finger at the very bottom of the tree, 
at the name REGULUS BLACK. A date of death (some 
fifteen years previously) followed the date of birth. 

“He was younger than me,” said Sirius, “and a much 
better son, as I was constantly reminded.” 

“But he died,” said Harry. 

“Yeah,” said Sirius. “Stupid idiot ... he joined the 
Death Eaters.” 

“You’re kidding!” 

“Come on, Harry, haven’t you seen enough of this 
house to tell what kind of wizards my family were?” 
said Sirius testily. 

“Were — were your parents Death Eaters as well?” 

“No, no, but believe me, they thought Voldemort had 
the right idea, they were all for the purification of the 
Wizarding race, getting rid of Muggle-borns and 
having purebloods in charge. They weren’t alone 
either, there were quite a few people, before 
Voldemort showed his true colors, who thought he 
had the right idea about things... They got cold feet 
when they saw what he was prepared to do to get 
power, though. But I bet my parents thought Regulus 
was a right little hero for joining up at first.” 

“Was he killed by an Auror?” Harry asked tentatively. 

“Oh no,” said Sirius. “No, he was murdered by 
Voldemort. Or on Voldemort’s orders, more likely, I 
doubt Regulus was ever important enough to be killed 
by Voldemort in person. From what I found out after 
he died, he got in so far, then panicked about what he 
was being asked to do and tried to back out. Well, you 
Page | 145Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




don’t just hand in your resignation to Voldemort. It’s 
a lifetime of service or death.” 

“Lunch,” said Mrs. Weasley’s voice. 

She was holding her wand high in front of her, 
balancing a huge tray loaded with sandwiches and 
cake on its tip. She was very red in the face and still 
looked angry. The others moved over to her, eager for 
some food, but Harry remained with Sirius, who had 
bent closer to the tapestry. 

“I haven’t looked at this for years. There’s Phineas 
Nigellus ... my great-great-grandfather, see? Least 
popular headmaster Hogwarts ever had . . . and 
Araminta Meliflua . . . cousin of my mother’s . . . tried to 
force through a Ministry Bill to make Muggle-hunting 
legal . . . and dear Aunt Elladora . . . she started the 
family tradition of beheading house-elves when they 
got too old to carry tea trays ... of course, anytime the 
family produced someone halfway decent they were 
disowned. I see Tonks isn’t on here. Maybe that’s why 
Kreacher won’t take orders from her — he’s supposed 
to do whatever anyone in the family asks him...” 

“You and Tonks are related?” Harry asked, surprised. 

“Oh yeah, her mother, Andromeda, was my favorite 
cousin,” said Sirius, examining the tapestry carefully. 
“No, Andromeda’s not on here either, look — ” 

He pointed to another small round burn mark 
between two names, Bellatrix and Narcissa. 

“Andromeda’s sisters are still here because they made 
lovely, respectable pure-blood marriages, but 
Andromeda married a Muggle-born, Ted Tonks, so — ” 



Page | 146Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Sirius mimed blasting the tapestry with a wand and 
laughed sourly. Harry, however, did not laugh; he was 
too busy staring at the names to the right of 
Andromeda’s burn mark. A double line of gold 
embroidery linked Narcissa Black with Lucius Malfoy, 
and a single vertical gold line from their names led to 
the name Draco. 

“You’re related to the Malfoys!” 

“The pure-blood families are all interrelated,” said 
Sirius. “If you’re only going to let your sons and 
daughters marry purebloods your choice is very 
limited, there are hardly any of us left. Molly and I are 
cousins by marriage and Arthur’s something like my 
second cousin once removed. But there’s no point 
looking for them on here — if ever a family was a 
bunch of blood traitors it’s the Weasleys.” 

But Harry was now looking at the name to the left of 
Andromeda’s burn: Bellatrix Black, which was 
connected by a double line to Rodolphus Lestrange. 

“Lestrange ...” Harry said aloud. The name had 
stirred something in his memory; he knew it from 
somewhere, but for a moment he couldn’t think 
where, though it gave him an odd, creeping sensation 
in the pit of his stomach. 

“They’re in Azkaban,” said Sirius shortly. 

Harry looked at him curiously. 

“Bellatrix and her husband Rodolphus came in with 
Barty Crouch, Junior,” said Sirius in the same 
brusque voice. “Rodolphus ’s brother, Rabastan, was 
with them too.” 



Page | 147Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




And Harry remembered: He had seen Bellatrix 
Lestrange inside Dumbledore’s Pensieve, the strange 
device in which thoughts and memories could be 
stored: a tall dark woman with heavy-lidded eyes, 
who had stood at her trial and proclaimed her 
continuing allegiance to Lord Voldemort, her pride 
that she had tried to find him after his downfall and 
her conviction that she would one day be rewarded 
for her loyalty. 

“You never said she was your — ” 

“Does it matter if she’s my cousin?” snapped Sirius. 
“As far as I’m concerned, they’re not my family. She’s 
certainly not my family. I haven’t seen her since I was 
your age, unless you count a glimpse of her coming in 
to Azkaban. D’you think I’m proud of having relatives 
like her?” 

“Sorry,” said Harry quickly, “I didn’t mean — I was 
just surprised, that’s all — ” 

“It doesn’t matter, don’t apologize,” Sirius mumbled at 
once. He turned away from the tapestry, his hands 
deep in his pockets. “I don’t like being back here,” he 
said, staring across the drawing room. “I never 
thought I’d be stuck in this house again.” 

Harry understood completely. He knew how he would 
feel if forced, when he was grown up and thought he 
was free of the place forever, to return and live at 
number four, Privet Drive. 

“It’s ideal for headquarters, of course,” Sirius said. 

“My father put every security measure known to 
Wizard-kind on it when he lived here. It’s Unplottable, 
so Muggles could never come and call — as if they’d 
have wanted to — and now Dumbledore’s added his 
protection, you’d be hard put to find a safer house 
Page | 148Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




anywhere. Dumbledore’s Secret-Keeper for the Order, 
you know — nobody can find headquarters unless he 
tells them personally where it is — that note Moody 
showed you last night, that was from Dumbledore...” 
Sirius gave a short, barklike laugh. “If my parents 
could see the use it was being put to now ... well, my 
mother’s portrait should give you some idea...” 

He scowled for a moment, then sighed. 

“I wouldn’t mind if I could just get out occasionally 
and do something useful. I’ve asked Dumbledore 
whether I can escort you to your hearing — as 
Snuffles, obviously — so I can give you a bit of moral 
support, what d’you think?” 

Harry felt as though his stomach had sunk through 
the dusty carpet. He had not thought about the 
hearing once since dinner the previous evening; in the 
excitement of being back with the people he liked 
best, of hearing everything that was going on, it had 
completely flown his mind. At Sirius’s words, 
however, the crushing sense of dread returned to 
him. He stared at Hermione and the Weasleys, all 
tucking into their sandwiches, and thought how he 
would feel if they went back to Hogwarts without him. 

“Don’t worry,” Sirius said. Harry looked up and 
realized that Sirius had been watching him. “I’m sure 
they’re going to clear you, there’s definitely something 
in the International Statute of Secrecy about being 
allowed to use magic to save your own life.” 

“But if they do expel me,” said Harry, quietly, “can I 
come back here and live with you?” 

Sirius smiled sadly. 

“We’ll see.” 

Page | 149Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“I’d feel a lot better about the hearing if I knew I didn’t 
have to go back to the Dursleys,” Harry pressed him. 



“They must be bad if you prefer this place,” said 
Sirius gloomily. 

“Hurry up, you two, or there won’t be any food left,” 
Mrs. Weasley called. 

Sirius heaved another great sigh, cast a dark look at 
the tapestry, and he and Harry went to join the 
others. 

Harry tried his best not to think about the hearing 
while they emptied the glass cabinets that afternoon. 
Fortunately for him, it was a job that required a lot of 
concentration, as many of the objects in there seemed 
very reluctant to leave their dusty shelves. Sirius 
sustained a bad bite from a silver snuffbox; within 
seconds, his bitten hand had developed an 
unpleasant crusty covering like a tough brown glove. 

“It’s okay,” he said, examining the hand with interest 
before tapping it lightly with his wand and restoring 
its skin to normal, “must be Wartcap powder in 
there.” 

He threw the box aside into the sack where they were 
depositing the debris from the cabinets; Harry saw 
George wrap his own hand carefully in a cloth 
moments later and sneak the box into his already 
doxy-filled pocket. 

They found an unpleasant-looking silver instrument, 
something like a many-legged pair of tweezers, which 
scuttled up Harry’s arm like a spider when he picked 
it up, and attempted to puncture his skin; Sirius 
seized it and smashed it with a heavy book entitled 
Nature’s Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy. There was a 
Page | 150Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




musical box that emitted a faintly sinister, tinkling 
tune when wound, and they all found themselves 
becoming curiously weak and sleepy until Ginny had 
the sense to slam the lid shut; also a heavy locket 
that none of them could open, a number of ancient 
seals and, in a dusty box, an Order of Merlin, First 
Class, that had been awarded to Sirius’s grandfather 
for “Services to the Ministry.” 

“It means he gave them a load of gold,” said Sirius 
contemptuously, throwing the medal into the rubbish 
sack. 

Several times, Kreacher sidled into the room and 
attempted to smuggle things away under his 
loincloth, muttering horrible curses every time they 
caught him at it. When Sirius wrested a large golden 
ring bearing the Black crest from his grip Kreacher 
actually burst into furious tears and left the room 
sobbing under his breath and calling Sirius names 
Harry had never heard before. 

“It was my father’s,” said Sirius, throwing the ring 
into the sack. “Kreacher wasn’t quite as devoted to 
him as to my mother, but I still caught him snogging 
a pair of my father’s old trousers last week.” 

Mrs. Weasley kept them all working very hard over 
the next few days. The drawing room took three days 
to decontaminate; finally the only undesirable things 
left in it were the tapestry of the Black family tree, 
which resisted all their attempts to remove it from the 
wall, and the rattling writing desk; Moody had not 
dropped by headquarters yet, so they could not be 
sure what was inside it. 

They moved from the drawing room to a dining room 
on the ground floor where they found spiders large as 
saucers lurking in the dresser (Ron left the room 

Page | 151Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




hurriedly to make a cup of tea and did not return for 
an hour and a half) . The china, which bore the Black 
crest and motto, was all thrown unceremoniously into 
a sack by Sirius, and the same fate met a set of old 
photographs in tarnished silver frames, all of whose 
occupants squealed shrilly as the glass covering them 
smashed. 

Snape might refer to their work as “cleaning,” but in 
Harry’s opinion they were really waging war on the 
house, which was putting up a very good fight, aided 
and abetted by Kreacher. The house-elf kept 
appearing wherever they were congregated, his 
muttering becoming more and more offensive as he 
attempted to remove anything he could from the 
rubbish sacks. Sirius went as far as to threaten him 
with clothes, but Kreacher fixed him with a watery 
stare and said, “Master must do as Master wishes,” 
before turning away and muttering very loudly, “but 
Master will not turn Kreacher away, no, because 
Kreacher knows what they are up to, oh yes, he is 
plotting against the Dark Lord, yes, with these 
Mudbloods and traitors and scum...” 

At which Sirius, ignoring Hermione’s protests, seized 
Kreacher by the back of his loincloth and threw him 
bodily from the room. 

The doorbell rang several times a day, which was the 
cue for Sirius’s mother to start shrieking again, and 
for Harry and the others to attempt to eavesdrop on 
the visitor, though they gleaned very little from the 
brief glimpses and snatches of conversation they were 
able to sneak before Mrs. Weasley recalled them to 
their tasks. Snape flitted in and out of the house 
several times more, though to Harry’s relief they never 
came face-to-face; he also caught sight of his 
Transfiguration teacher, Professor McGonagall, 



Page | 152Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




looking very odd in a Muggle dress and coat, though 
she also seemed too busy to linger. 

Sometimes, however, the visitors stayed to help; 

Tonks joined them for a memorable afternoon in 
which they found a murderous old ghoul lurking in 
an upstairs toilet, and Lupin, who was staying in the 
house with Sirius but who left it for long periods to do 
mysterious work for the Order, helped them repair a 
grandfather clock that had developed the unpleasant 
habit of shooting heavy bolts at passersby. 
Mundungus redeemed himself slightly in Mrs. 
Weasley’s eyes by rescuing Ron from an ancient set of 
purple robes that had tried to strangle him when he 
removed them from their wardrobe. 

Despite the fact that he was still sleeping badly, still 
having dreams about corridors and locked doors that 
made his scar prickle, Harry was managing to have 
fun for the first time all summer. As long as he was 
busy he was happy; when the action abated, however, 
whenever he dropped his guard, or lay exhausted in 
bed watching blurred shadows move across the 
ceiling, the thought of the looming Ministry hearing 
returned to him. Fear jabbed at his insides like 
needles as he wondered what was going to happen to 
him if he was expelled. The idea was so terrible that 
he did not dare voice it aloud, not even to Ron and 
Hermione, who, though he often saw them whispering 
together and casting anxious looks in his direction, 
followed his lead in not mentioning it. Sometimes he 
could not prevent his imagination showing him a 
faceless Ministry official who was snapping his wand 
in two and ordering him back to the Dursleys’ ... but 
he would not go. He was determined on that. He 
would come back here to Grimmauld Place and live 
with Sirius. 



Page | 153Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




He felt as though a brick had dropped into his 
stomach when Mrs. Weasley turned to him during 
dinner on Wednesday evening and said quietly, “I’ve 
ironed your best clothes for tomorrow morning, 

Harry, and I want you to wash your hair tonight too. 

A good first impression can work wonders.” 

Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Ginny all stopped 
talking and looked over at him. Harry nodded and 
tried to keep eating his chops, but his mouth had 
become so dry he could not chew. 

“How am I getting there?” he asked Mrs. Weasley, 
trying to sound unconcerned. 

“Arthur’s taking you to work with him,” said Mrs. 
Weasley gently. 

Mr. Weasley smiled encouragingly at Harry across the 
table. 

“You can wait in my office until it’s time for the 
hearing,” he said. 

Harry looked over at Sirius, but before he could ask 
the question, Mrs. Weasley had answered it. 

“Professor Dumbledore doesn’t think it’s a good idea 
for Sirius to go with you, and I must say I — ” 

“ — think he’s quite right,” said Sirius through 
clenched teeth. 

Mrs. Weasley pursed her lips. 

“When did Dumbledore tell you that?” Harry said, 
staring at Sirius. 



Page | 154Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“He came last night, when you were in bed,” said Mr. 
Weasley. 

Sirius stabbed moodily at a potato with his fork. 
Harry dropped his own eyes to his plate. The thought 
that Dumbledore had been in the house on the eve of 
his hearing and not asked to see him made him feel, 
if that were possible, even worse. 



Page | 155Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




7 




THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC 

Harry awoke at half-past five the next morning as 
abruptly and completely as if somebody had yelled in 
his ear. For a few moments he lay immobile as the 
prospect of the hearing filled every tiny particle of his 
brain, then, unable to bear it, he leapt out of bed and 
put on his glasses. Mrs. Weasley had laid out his 
freshly laundered jeans and T-shirt at the foot of his 
bed. Harry scrambled into them. The blank picture on 
the wall sniggered again. 

Ron was lying sprawled on his back with his mouth 
wide open, fast asleep. He did not stir as Harry 
crossed the room, stepped out onto the landing, and 
closed the door softly behind him. Trying not to think 
of the next time he would see Ron, when they might 
no longer be fellow students at Hogwarts, Harry 
walked quietly down the stairs, past the heads of 
Kreacher’s ancestors, and into the kitchen. 

He had expected it to be empty, but it was not. When 
he reached the door he heard the soft rumble of 
voices on the other side and when he pushed it open 

Page | 156Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 



he saw Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, Sirius, Lupin, and 
Tonks sitting there almost as though they were 
waiting for him. All were fully dressed except Mrs. 
Weasley, who was wearing a quilted, purple dressing 
gown. She leapt to her feet the moment he entered. 

“Breakfast,” she said as she pulled out her wand and 
hurried over to the fire. 

“M-m-morning, Harry,” yawned Tonks. Her hair was 
blonde and curly this morning. “Sleep all right?” 

“Yeah,” said Harry. 

“I’ve b-b-been up all night,” she said, with another 
shuddering yawn. “Come and sit down...” 

She drew out a chair, knocking over the one beside it 
in the process. 

“What do you want, Harry?” Mrs. Weasley called. 
“Porridge? Muffins? Kippers? Bacon and eggs? 

Toast?” 

“Just — just toast, thanks,” said Harry. 

Lupin glanced at Harry, then said to Tonks, “What 
were you saying about Scrimgeour?” 

“Oh ... yeah ... well, we need to be a bit more careful, 
he’s been asking Kingsley and me funny questions...” 

Harry felt vaguely grateful that he was not required to 
join in the conversation. His insides were squirming. 
Mrs. Weasley placed a couple of pieces of toast and 
marmalade in front of him; he tried to eat, but it was 
like chewing carpet. Mrs. Weasley sat down on his 
other side and started fussing with his T-shirt,

tucking in the label and smoothing out creases across 
the shoulders. He wished she wouldn’t. 

"... and I’ll have to tell Dumbledore I can’t do night 
duty tomorrow, I’m just t-t-too tired,” Tonks finished, 
yawning hugely again. 

“I’ll cover for you,” said Mr. Weasley. “I’m okay, I’ve 
got a report to finish anyway...” 

Mr. Weasley was not wearing wizard’s robes but a 
pair of pinstriped trousers and an old bomber jacket. 
He turned from Tonks to Harry. 

“How are you feeling?” 

Harry shrugged. 

“It’ll all be over soon,” Mr. Weasley said bracingly. “In 
a few hours’ time you’ll be cleared.” 

Harry said nothing. 

“The hearing’s on my floor, in Amelia Bones ’s office. 
She’s Head of the Department of Magical Law 
Enforcement and she’s the one who’ll be questioning 
you.” 

“Amelia Bones is okay, Harry,” said Tonks earnestly. 
“She’s fair, she’ll hear you out.” 

Harry nodded, still unable to think of anything to say. 

“Don’t lose your temper,” said Sirius abruptly. “Be 
polite and stick to the facts.” 

Harry nodded again.

“The law’s on your side,” said Lupin quietly. “Even 
underage wizards are allowed to use magic in life- 
threatening situations.” 

Something very cold trickled down the back of Harry’s 
neck; for a moment he thought someone was putting 
a Disillusionment Charm on him again, then he 
realized that Mrs. Weasley was attacking his hair with 
a wet comb. She pressed hard on the top of his head. 

“Doesn’t it ever lie flat?” she said desperately. 

Harry shook his head. 

Mr. Weasley checked his watch and looked up at 
Harry. 

“I think we’ll go now,” he said. “We’re a bit early, but I 
think you’ll be better off there than hanging around 
here.” 

“Okay,” said Harry automatically, dropping his toast 
and getting to his feet. 

“You’ll be all right, Harry,” said Tonks, patting him on 
the arm. 

“Good luck,” said Lupin. “I’m sure it will be fine.” 

“And if it’s not,” said Sirius grimly, “I’ll see to Amelia 
Bones for you...” 

Harry smiled weakly. Mrs. Weasley hugged him. 

“We’ve all got our fingers crossed,” she said. 

“Right,” said Harry. “Well ... see you later then.” 



Page | 159Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




He followed Mr. Weasley upstairs and along the hall. 
He could hear Sirius’s mother grunting in her sleep 
behind her curtains. Mr. Weasley unbolted the door 
and they stepped out into the cold, gray dawn. 

“You don’t normally walk to work, do you?” Harry 
asked him, as they set off briskly around the square. 

“No, I usually Apparate,” said Mr. Weasley, “but 
obviously you can’t, and I think it’s best we arrive in a 
thoroughly non-magical fashion . . . makes a better 
impression, given what you’re being disciplined for...” 

Mr. Weasley kept his hand inside his jacket as they 
walked. Harry knew it was clenched around his wand. 
The run-down streets were almost deserted, but when 
they arrived at the miserable little Underground 
station they found it already full of early morning 
commuters. As ever when he found himself in close 
proximity to Muggles going about their daily business, 
Mr. Weasley was hard put to contain his enthusiasm. 

“Simply fabulous,” he whispered, indicating the 
automatic ticket machines. “Wonderfully ingenious.” 

“They’re out of order,” said Harry, pointing at the 
sign. 

“Yes, but even so ...” said Mr. Weasley, beaming 
fondly at them. 

They bought their tickets instead from a sleepy- 
looking guard (Harry handled the transaction, as Mr. 
Weasley was not very good with Muggle money) and 
five minutes later they were boarding an Underground 
train that rattled them off toward the center of 
London. Mr. Weasley kept anxiously checking and 
rechecking the Underground map above the windows. 



Page | 160Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Four stops, Harry ... three stops left now ... two 
stops to go, Harry ...” 

They got off at a station in the very heart of London, 
swept from the train in a tide of besuited men and 
women carrying briefcases. Up the escalator they 
went, through the ticket barrier (Mr. Weasley 
delighted with the way the stile swallowed his ticket), 
and emerged onto a broad street lined with imposing- 
looking buildings, already full of traffic. 

“Where are we?” said Mr. Weasley blankly, and for 
one heart-stopping moment Harry thought they had 
gotten off at the wrong station despite Mr. Weasley’s 
continual references to the map; but a second later he 
said, “Ah yes ... this way, Harry,” and led him down a 
side road. 

“Sorry,” he said, “but I never come by train and it all 
looks rather different from a Muggle perspective. As a 
matter of fact I’ve never even used the visitor’s 
entrance before.” 

The farther they walked, the smaller and less 
imposing the buildings became, until finally they 
reached a street that contained several rather 
shabby-looking offices, a pub, and an overflowing 
dumpster. Harry had expected a rather more 
impressive location for the Ministry of Magic. 

“Here we are,” said Mr. Weasley brightly, pointing at 
an old red telephone box, which was missing several 
panes of glass and stood before a heavily graffittied 
wall. “After you, Harry.” 

He opened the telephone box door. 

Harry stepped inside, wondering what on earth this 
was about. Mr. Weasley folded himself in beside Harry 

Page | 161Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




and closed the door. It was a tight fit; Harry was 
jammed against the telephone apparatus, which was 
hanging crookedly from the wall as though a vandal 
had tried to rip it off. Mr. Weasley reached past Harry 
for the receiver. 

“Mr. Weasley, I think this might be out of order too,” 
Harry said. 

“No, no, I’m sure it’s fine,” said Mr. Weasley, holding 
the receiver above his head and peering at the dial. 
“Let’s see ... six ...” he dialed the number, “two ... four 
... and another four ... and another two ...” 

As the dial whirred smoothly back into place, a cool 
female voice sounded inside the telephone box, not 
from the receiver in Mr. Weasley’s hand, but as loudly 
and plainly as though an invisible woman were 
standing right beside them. 

“Welcome to the Ministry of Magic. Please state your 
name and business.” 

“Er ...” said Mr. Weasley, clearly uncertain whether he 
should talk into the receiver or not; he compromised 
by holding the mouthpiece to his ear, “Arthur 
Weasley, Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office, here to 
escort Harry Potter, who has been asked to attend a 
disciplinary hearing...” 

“Thank you,” said the cool female voice. “Visitor, 
please take the badge and attach it to the front of 
your robes.” 

There was a click and a rattle, and Harry saw 
something slide out of the metal chute where 
returned coins usually appeared. He picked it up: It 
was a square silver badge with Harry Potter, 



Page | 162Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Disciplinary Hearing on it. He pinned it to the front of 
his T-shirt as the female voice spoke again. 

“Visitor to the Ministry, you are required to submit to 
a search and present your wand for registration at the 
security desk, which is located at the far end of the 
Atrium.” 

The floor of the telephone box shuddered. They were 
sinking slowly into the ground. Harry watched 
apprehensively as the pavement rose up past the 
glass windows of the telephone box until darkness 
closed over their heads. Then he could see nothing at 
all; he could only hear a dull grinding noise as the 
telephone box made its way down through the earth. 
After about a minute, though it felt much longer to 
Harry, a chink of golden light illuminated his feet 
and, widening, rose up his body, until it hit him in 
the face and he had to blink to stop his eyes from 
watering. 

“The Ministry of Magic wishes you a pleasant day,” 
said the woman’s voice. 

The door of the telephone box sprang open and Mr. 
Weasley stepped out of it, followed by Harry, whose 
mouth had fallen open. 

They were standing at one end of a very long and 
splendid hall with a highly polished, dark wood floor. 
The peacock-blue ceiling was inlaid with gleaming 
golden symbols that were continually moving and 
changing like some enormous heavenly notice board. 
The walls on each side were paneled in shiny dark 
wood and had many gilded fireplaces set into them. 
Every few seconds a witch or wizard would emerge 
from one of the left-hand fireplaces with a soft 
whoosh ; on the right-hand side, short queues of 



Page | 163Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




wizards were forming before each fireplace, waiting to 
depart. 

Halfway down the hall was a fountain. A group of 
golden statues, larger than life-size, stood in the 
middle of a circular pool. Tallest of them all was a 
noble-looking wizard with his wand pointing straight 
up in the air. Grouped around him were a beautiful 
witch, a centaur, a goblin, and a house-elf. The last 
three were all looking adoringly up at the witch and 
wizard. Glittering jets of water were flying from the 
ends of the two wands, the point of the centaur’s 
arrow, the tip of the goblin’s hat, and each of the 
house-elf’s ears, so that the tinkling hiss of falling 
water was added to the pops and cracks of 
Apparators and the clatter of footsteps as hundreds of 
witches and wizards, most of whom were wearing 
glum, early-morning looks, strode toward a set of 
golden gates at the far end of the hall. 

“This way,” said Mr. Weasley. 

They joined the throng, wending their way between 
the Ministry workers, some of whom were carrying 
tottering piles of parchment, others battered 
briefcases, still others reading the Daily Prophet as 
they walked. As they passed the fountain Harry saw 
silver Sickles and bronze Knuts glinting up at him 
from the bottom of the pool. A small, smudged sign 
beside it read: 

All proceeds from the Fountain of Magical Brethren will 
be given to 

St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries 

If I’m not expelled from Hogwarts, I’ll put in ten 
Galleons, Harry found himself thinking desperately. 



Page | 164Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Over here, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley, and they 
stepped out of the stream of Ministry employees 
heading for the golden gates, toward a desk on the 
left, over which hung a sign saying SECURITY. A 
badly shaven wizard in peacock-blue robes looked up 
as they approached and put down his Daily Prophet. 

“I’m escorting a visitor,” said Mr. Weasley, gesturing 
toward Harry. 

“Step over here,” said the wizard in a bored voice. 

Harry walked closer to him and the wizard held up a 
long golden rod, thin and flexible as a car aerial, and 
passed it up and down Harry’s front and back. 

“Wand,” grunted the security wizard at Harry, putting 
down the golden instrument and holding out his 
hand. 

Harry produced his wand. The wizard dropped it onto 
a strange brass instrument, which looked something 
like a set of scales with only one dish. It began to 
vibrate. A narrow strip of parchment came speeding 
out of a slit in the base. The wizard tore this off and 
read the writing upon it. 

“Eleven inches, phoenix-feather core, been in use four 
years. That correct?” 

“Yes,” said Harry nervously. 

“I keep this,” said the wizard, impaling the slip of 
parchment on a small brass spike. “You get this 
back,” he added, thrusting the wand at Harry. 

“Thank you.” 

“Hang on...” said the wizard slowly. 

Page | 165Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




His eyes had darted from the silver visitor’s badge on 
Harry’s chest to his forehead. 

“Thank you, Eric,” said Mr. Weasley firmly, and 
grasping Harry by the shoulder, he steered him away 
from the desk and back into the stream of wizards 
and witches walking through the golden gates. 

Jostled slightly by the crowd, Harry followed Mr. 
Weasley through the gates into the smaller hall 
beyond, where at least twenty lifts stood behind 
wrought golden grilles. Harry and Mr. Weasley joined 
the crowd around one of them. A big, bearded wizard 
holding a large cardboard box stood nearby. The box 
was emitting rasping noises. 

“All right, Arthur?” said the wizard, nodding at Mr. 
Weasley. 

“What’ve you got there, Bob?” asked Mr. Weasley, 
looking at the box. 

“We’re not sure,” said the wizard seriously. “We 
thought it was a bog-standard chicken until it started 
breathing fire. Looks like a serious breach of the Ban 
on Experimental Breeding to me.” 

With a great jangling and clattering a lift descended in 
front of them; the golden grille slid back and Harry 
and Mr. Weasley moved inside it with the rest of the 
crowd. Harry found himself jammed against the back 
wall of the lift. Several witches and wizards were 
looking at him curiously; he stared at his feet to avoid 
catching anyone’s eye, flattening his fringe as he did 
so. The grilles slid shut with a crash and the lift 
ascended slowly, chains rattling all the while, while 
the same cool female voice Harry had heard in the 
telephone box rang out again. 



Page | 166Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Level seven, Department of Magical Games and 
Sports, incorporating the British and Irish Quidditch 
League Headquarters, Official Gobstones Club, and 
Ludicrous Patents Office.” 

The lift doors opened; Harry glimpsed an untidy- 
looking corridor, with various posters of Quidditch 
teams tacked lopsidedly on the walls; one of the 
wizards in the lift, who was carrying an armful of 
broomsticks, extricated himself with difficulty and 
disappeared down the corridor. The doors closed, the 
lift juddered upward again, and the woman’s voice 
said, “Level six, Department of Magical Transport, 
incorporating the Floo Network Authority, Broom 
Regulatory Control, Portkey Office, and Apparation 
Test Center.” 

Once again the lift doors opened and four or five 
witches and wizards got out; at the same time, several 
paper airplanes swooped into the lift. Harry stared up 
at them as they flapped idly around above his head; 
they were a pale violet color and he could see 
MINISTRY OF MAGIC stamped along the edges of 
their wings. 

“Just Interdepartmental memos,” Mr. Weasley 
muttered to him. “We used to use owls, but the mess 
was unbelievable ... droppings all over the desks ...” 

As they clattered upward again, the memos flapped 
around the swaying lamp in the lift’s ceiling. 

“Level five, Department of International Magical 
Cooperation, incorporating the International Magical 
Trading Standards Body, the International Magical 
Office of Law, and the International Confederation of 
Wizards, British Seats.” 



Page | 167Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




When the doors opened, two of the memos zoomed 
out with a few more witches and wizards, but several 
more memos zoomed in, so that the light from the 
lamp in the ceiling flickered and flashed as they 
darted around it. 

“Level four, Department for the Regulation and 
Control of Magical Creatures, incorporating Beast, 
Being, and Spirit Divisions, Goblin Liaison Office, and 
Pest Advisory Bureau.” 

“ ’S’cuse,” said the wizard carrying the fire-breathing 
chicken and he left the lift pursued by a little flock of 
memos. The doors clanged shut yet again. 

“Level three, Department of Magical Accidents and 
Catastrophes, including the Accidental Magic 
Reversal Squad, Obliviator Headquarters, and 
Muggle-Worthy Excuse Committee.” 

Everybody left the lift on this floor except Mr. 

Weasley, Harry, and a witch who was reading an 
extremely long piece of parchment that was trailing 
on the ground. The remaining memos continued to 
soar around the lamp as the lift juddered upward 
again, and then the doors opened and the voice said, 
“Level two, Department of Magical Law Enforcement, 
including the Improper Use of Magic Office, Auror 
Headquarters, and Wizengamot Administration 
Services.” 

“This is us, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley, and they 
followed the witch out of the lift into a corridor lined 
with doors. “My office is on the other side of the floor.” 

“Mr. Weasley,” said Harry, as they passed a window 
through which sunlight was streaming, “aren’t we 
underground?” 



Page | 168Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Yes, we are,” said Mr. Weasley, “those are enchanted 
windows; Magical Maintenance decide what weather 
we’re getting every day. We had two months of 
hurricanes last time they were angling for a pay 
raise... Just round here, Harry.” 

They turned a corner, walked through a pair of heavy 
oak doors, and emerged in a cluttered, open area 
divided into cubicles, which were buzzing with talk 
and laughter. Memos were zooming in and out of 
cubicles like miniature rockets. A lopsided sign on the 
nearest cubicle read AUROR HEADQUARTERS. 

Harry looked surreptitiously through the doorways as 
they passed. The Aurors had covered their cubicle 
walls with everything from pictures of wanted wizards 
and photographs of their families, to posters of their 
favorite Quidditch teams and articles from the Daily 
Prophet A scarlet-robed man with a ponytail longer 
than Bill’s was sitting with his boots up on his desk, 
dictating a report to his quill. A little farther along, a 
witch with a patch over her eye was talking over the 
top of her cubicle wall to Kingsley Shacklebolt. 

“Morning, Weasley,” said Kingsley carelessly, as they 
drew nearer. “I’ve been wanting a word with you, have 
you got a second?” 

“Yes, if it really is a second,” said Mr. Weasley, “I’m in 
rather a hurry.” 

They were talking to each other as though they hardly 
knew each other, and when Harry opened his mouth 
to say hello to Kingsley, Mr. Weasley stood on his 
foot. They followed Kingsley along the row and into 
the very last cubicle. 

Harry received a slight shock; Sirius’s face was 
blinking down at him from every direction. Newspaper 

Page | 169Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




cuttings and old photographs — even the one of 
Sirius being best man at the Potters’ wedding — 
papered the walls. The only Sirius-free space was a 
map of the world in which little red pins were glowing 
like jewels. 

“Here,” said Kingsley brusquely to Mr. Weasley, 
shoving a sheaf of parchment into his hand, “I need 
as much information as possible on flying Muggle 
vehicles sighted in the last twelve months. We’ve 
received information that Black might still be using 
his old motorcycle.” 

Kingsley tipped Harry an enormous wink and added, 
in a whisper, “Give him the magazine, he might find it 
interesting.” Then he said in normal tones, “And don’t 
take too long, Weasley, the delay on that firelegs 
report held our investigation up for a month.” 

“If you had read my report you would know that the 
term is ‘firearms,’ ” said Mr. Weasley coolly. “And I’m 
afraid you’ll have to wait for information on 
motorcycles, we’re extremely busy at the moment.” He 
dropped his voice and said, “If you can get away 
before seven, Molly’s making meatballs.” 

He beckoned to Harry and led him out of Kingsley’s 
cubicle, through a second set of oak doors, into 
another passage, turned left, marched along another 
corridor, turned right into a dimly lit and distinctly 
shabby corridor, and finally reached a dead end, 
where a door on the left stood ajar, revealing a broom 
cupboard, and a door on the right bore a tarnished 
brass plaque reading MISUSE OF MUGGLE 
ARTIFACTS. 

Mr. Weasley’s dingy office seemed to be slightly 
smaller than the broom cupboard. Two desks had 
been crammed inside it and there was barely room to 

Page | 170Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




move around them because of all the overflowing 
filing cabinets lining the walls, on top of which were 
tottering piles of files. The little wall space available 
bore witness to Mr. Weasley’s obsessions; there were 
several posters of cars, including one of a dismantled 
engine, two illustrations of postboxes he seemed to 
have cut out of Muggle children’s books, and a 
diagram showing how to wire a plug. 

Sitting on top of Mr. Weasley’s overflowing in-tray was 
an old toaster that was hiccuping in a disconsolate 
way and a pair of empty leather gloves that were 
twiddling their thumbs. A photograph of the Weasley 
family stood beside the in-tray. Harry noticed that 
Percy appeared to have walked out of it. 

“We haven’t got a window,” said Mr. Weasley 
apologetically, taking off his bomber jacket and 
placing it on the back of his chair. “We’ve asked, but 
they don’t seem to think we need one. Have a seat, 
Harry, doesn’t look as if Perkins is in yet.” 

Harry squeezed himself into the chair behind 
Perkins’s desk while Mr. Weasley rifled through the 
sheaf of parchment Kingsley Shacklebolt had given 
him. 

“Ah,” he said, grinning, as he extracted a copy of a 
magazine entitled The Quibbler from its midst, “yes 
...” He flicked through it. “Yes, he’s right, I’m sure 
Sirius will find that very amusing — oh dear, what’s 
this now?” 

A memo had just zoomed in through the open door 
and fluttered to rest on top of the hiccuping toaster. 
Mr. Weasley unfolded it and read aloud, “ Third 
regurgitating public toilet reported in Bethnal Green, 
kindly investigate immediately. ’ This is getting 
ridiculous...” 

Page | 171Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“A regurgitating toilet?” 



“Anti-Muggle pranksters,” said Mr. Weasley, frowning. 
“We had two last week, one in Wimbledon, one in 
Elephant and Castle. Muggles are pulling the flush 
and instead of everything disappearing — well, you 
can imagine. The poor things keep calling in those — 
those pumbles, I think they’re called — you know, the 
ones who mend pipes and things — ” 

“Plumbers?” 

“ — exactly, yes, but of course they’re flummoxed. I 
only hope we can catch whoever’s doing it.” 

“Will it be Aurors who catch them?” 

“Oh no, this is too trivial for Aurors, it’ll be the 
ordinary Magical Law Enforcement Patrol — ah, 

Harry, this is Perkins.” 

A stooped, timid-looking old wizard with fluffy white 
hair had just entered the room, panting. 

“Oh Arthur!” he said desperately, without looking at 
Harry. “Thank goodness, I didn’t know what to do for 
the best, whether to wait here for you or not, I’ve just 
sent an owl to your home but you’ve obviously missed 
it — an urgent message came ten minutes ago — ” 

“I know about the regurgitating toilet,” said Mr. 
Weasley. 

“No, no, it’s not the toilet, it’s the Potter boy’s hearing 
— they’ve changed the time and venue — it starts at 
eight o’clock now and it’s down in old Courtroom Ten 



“Down in old — but they told me — Merlin’s beard — ” 

Page | 172Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Mr. Weasley looked at his watch, let out a yelp, and 
leapt from his chair. 

“Quick, Harry, we should have been there five 
minutes ago!” 

Perkins flattened himself against the filing cabinets as 
Mr. Weasley left the office at a run, Harry on his 
heels. 

“Why have they changed the time?” Harry said 
breathlessly as they hurtled past the Auror cubicles; 
people poked out their heads and stared as they 
streaked past. Harry felt as though he had left all his 
insides back at Perkins’s desk. 

“I’ve no idea, but thank goodness we got here so early, 
if you’d missed it it would have been catastrophic!” 

Mr. Weasley skidded to a halt beside the lifts and 
jabbed impatiently at the down button. 

“Come ON!” 

The lift clattered into view and they hurried inside. 
Every time it stopped Mr. Weasley cursed furiously 
and pummelled the number nine button. 

“Those courtrooms haven’t been used in years,” said 
Mr. Weasley angrily. “I can’t think why they’re doing it 
down there — unless — but no ...” 

A plump witch carrying a smoking goblet entered the 
lift at that moment, and Mr. Weasley did not 
elaborate. 

“The Atrium,” said the cool female voice and the 
golden grilles slid open, showing Harry a distant 
glimpse of the golden statues in the fountain. The 

Page | 173Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




plump witch got out and a sallow-skinned wizard with 
a very mournful face got in. 



“Morning, Arthur,” he said in a sepulchral voice as 
the lift began to descend. “Don’t often see you down 
here...” 

“Urgent business, Bode,” said Mr. Weasley, who was 
bouncing on the balls of his feet and throwing 
anxious looks over at Harry. 

“Ah, yes,” said Bode, surveying Harry unblinkingly. 

“Of course.” 

Harry barely had emotion to spare for Bode, but his 
unfaltering gaze did not make him feel any more 
comfortable. 

“Department of Mysteries,” said the cool female voice, 
and left it at that. 

“Quick, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley as the lift doors 
rattled open, and they sped up a corridor that was 
quite different from those above. The walls were bare; 
there were no windows and no doors apart from a 
plain black one set at the very end of the corridor. 
Harry expected them to go through it, but instead Mr. 
Weasley seized him by the arm and dragged him to 
the left, where there was an opening leading to a flight 
of steps. 

“Down here, down here,” panted Mr. Weasley, taking 
two steps at a time. “The lift doesn’t even come down 
this far ... why they’re doing it there ...” 

They reached the bottom of the steps and ran along 
yet another corridor, which bore a great resemblance 
to that which led to Snape’s dungeon at Hogwarts, 
with rough stone walls and torches in brackets. The 

Page | 174Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




doors they passed here were heavy wooden ones with 
iron bolts and keyholes. 

“Courtroom ... ten ... I think ... we’re nearly ... yes.” 

Mr. Weasley stumbled to a halt outside a grimy dark 
door with an immense iron lock and slumped against 
the wall, clutching at a stitch in his chest. 

“Go on,” he panted, pointing his thumb at the door. 
“Get in there.” 

“Aren’t — aren’t you coming with — ?” 

“No, no, I’m not allowed. Good luck!” 

Harry’s heart was beating a violent tattoo against his 
Adam’s apple. He swallowed hard, turned the heavy 
iron door handle, and stepped inside the courtroom.

8 




THE HEARING 

Harry gasped; he could not help himself. The large 
dungeon he had entered was horribly familiar. He had 
not only seen it before, he had been here before: This 
was the place he had visited inside Dumbledore’s 
Pensieve, the place where he had watched the 
Lestranges sentenced to life imprisonment in 
Azkaban. 

The walls were made of dark stone, dimly lit by 
torches. Empty benches rose on either side of him, 
but ahead, in the highest benches of all, were many 
shadowy figures. They had been talking in low voices, 
but as the heavy door swung closed behind Harry an 
ominous silence fell. 

A cold male voice rang across the courtroom. 

“You’re late.” 

“Sorry,” said Harry nervously. “I-I didn’t know the 
time had changed.” 



Page | 176Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 



“That is not the Wizengamot’s fault,” said the voice. 
“An owl was sent to you this morning. Take your 
seat.” 

Harry dropped his gaze to the chair in the center of 
the room, the arms of which were covered in chains. 
He had seen those chains spring to life and bind 
whoever sat between them. His footsteps echoed 
loudly as he walked across the stone floor. When he 
sat gingerly on the edge of the chair the chains 
clinked rather threateningly but did not bind him. 
Feeling rather sick he looked up at the people seated 
at the bench above. 

There were about fifty of them, all, as far as he could 
see, wearing plum-colored robes with an elaborately 
worked silver W on the left-hand side of the chest and 
all staring down their noses at him, some with very 
austere expressions, others looks of frank curiosity. 

In the very middle of the front row sat Cornelius 
Fudge, the Minister of Magic. Fudge was a portly man 
who often sported a lime-green bowler hat, though 
today he had dispensed with it; he had dispensed too 
with the indulgent smile he had once worn when he 
spoke to Harry. A broad, square-jawed witch with 
very short gray hair sat on Fudge’s left; she wore a 
monocle and looked forbidding. On Fudge’s right was 
another witch, but she was sitting so far back on the 
bench that her face was in shadow. 

“Very well,” said Fudge. “The accused being present 
— finally — let us begin. Are you ready?” he called 
down the row. 

“Yes, sir,” said an eager voice Harry knew. Ron’s 
brother Percy was sitting at the very end of the front 
bench. Harry looked at Percy, expecting some sign of 
recognition from him, but none came. Percy’s eyes, 

Page | 177Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




behind his horn-rimmed glasses, were fixed on his 
parchment, a quill poised in his hand. 



“Disciplinary hearing of the twelfth of August,” said 
Fudge in a ringing voice, and Percy began taking 
notes at once, “into offenses committed under the 
Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage 
Sorcery and the International Statute of Secrecy by 
Harry James Potter, resident at number four, Privet 
Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey. 

“Interrogators: Cornelius Oswald Fudge, Minister of 
Magic; Amelia Susan Bones, Head of the Department 
of Magical Law Enforcement; Dolores Jane Umbridge, 
Senior Undersecretary to the Minister. Court Scribe, 
Percy Ignatius Weasley — ” 

“ — Witness for the defense, Albus Percival Wulfric 
Brian Dumbledore,” said a quiet voice from behind 
Harry, who turned his head so fast he cricked his 
neck. 

Dumbledore was striding serenely across the room 
wearing long midnight-blue robes and a perfectly 
calm expression. His long silver beard and hair 
gleamed in the torchlight as he drew level with Harry 
and looked up at Fudge through the half-moon 
spectacles that rested halfway down his very crooked 
nose. 

The members of the Wizengamot were muttering. All 
eyes were now on Dumbledore. Some looked annoyed, 
others slightly frightened; two elderly witches in the 
back row, however, raised their hands and waved in 
welcome. 

A powerful emotion had risen in Harry’s chest at the 
sight of Dumbledore, a fortified, hopeful feeling rather 
like that which phoenix song gave him. He wanted to 

Page | 178Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




catch Dumbledore’s eye, but Dumbledore was not 
looking his way; he was continuing to look up at the 
obviously flustered Fudge. 

“Ah,” said Fudge, who looked thoroughly 
disconcerted. “Dumbledore. Yes. You — er — got our 

— er — message that the time and — er — place of 
the hearing had been changed, then?” 

“I must have missed it,” said Dumbledore cheerfully. 
“However, due to a lucky mistake I arrived at the 
Ministry three hours early, so no harm done.” 

“Yes — well — I suppose well need another chair — I 

— Weasley, could you — ?” 

“Not to worry, not to worry,” said Dumbledore 
pleasantly; he took out his wand, gave it a little flick, 
and a squashy chintz armchair appeared out of 
nowhere next to Harry. Dumbledore sat down, put the 
tips of his long fingers together, and looked at Fudge 
over them with an expression of polite interest. The 
Wizengamot was still muttering and fidgeting 
restlessly; only when Fudge spoke again did they 
settle down. 

“Yes,” said Fudge again, shuffling his notes. “Well, 
then. So. The charges. Yes.” 

He extricated a piece of parchment from the pile 
before him, took a deep breath, and read, “The 
charges against the accused are as follows: That he 
did knowingly, deliberately, and in full awareness of 
the illegality of his actions, having received a previous 
written warning from the Ministry of Magic on a 
similar charge, produce a Patronus Charm in a 
Muggle-inhabited area, in the presence of a Muggle, 
on August the second at twenty-three minutes past 
nine, which constitutes an offense under paragraph C 
Page | 179Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




of the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of 
Underage Sorcery, 1875, and also under section 
thirteen of the International Confederation of Wizards’ 
Statute of Secrecy. 

“You are Harry James Potter, of number four, Privet 
Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey?” Fudge said, glaring at 
Harry over the top of his parchment. 

“Yes,” Harry said. 

“You received an official warning from the Ministry for 
using illegal magic three years ago, did you not?” 

“Yes, but — ” 

“And yet you conjured a Patronus on the night of the 
second of August?” said Fudge. 

“Yes,” said Harry, “but — ” 

“Knowing that you are not permitted to use magic 
outside school while you are under the age of 
seventeen?” 

“Yes, but — ” 

“Knowing that you were in an area full of Muggles?” 
“Yes, but — ” 

“Fully aware that you were in close proximity to a 
Muggle at the time? 

“Yes,” said Harry angrily, “but I only used it because 
we were — ” 

The witch with the monocle on Fudge’s left cut across 
him in a booming voice. 

Page | 180Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“You produced a fully fledged Patronus?” 



“Yes,” said Harry, “because — ” 

“A corporeal Patronus?” 

“A — what?” said Harry. 

“Your Patronus had a clearly defined form? I mean to 
say, it was more than vapor or smoke?” 

“Yes,” said Harry, feeling both impatient and slightly 
desperate, “it’s a stag, it’s always a stag.” 

“Always?” boomed Madam Bones. “You have 
produced a Patronus before now?” 

“Yes” said Harry, “I’ve been doing it for over a year — 



“And you are fifteen years old?” 

“Yes, and — ” 

“You learned this at school?” 

“Yes, Professor Lupin taught me in my third year, 
because of the — ” 

“Impressive,” said Madam Bones, staring down at 
him, “a true Patronus at that age ... very impressive 
indeed.” 

Some of the wizards and witches around her were 
muttering again; a few nodded, but others were 
frowning and shaking their heads. 

“It’s not a question of how impressive the magic was,” 
said Fudge in a testy voice. “In fact, the more 

Page | 181Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




impressive the worse it is, I would have thought, given 
that the boy did it in plain view of a Muggle!” 



Those who had been frowning now murmured in 
agreement, but it was the sight of Percy’s 
sanctimonious little nod that goaded Harry into 
speech. 

“I did it because of the dementors!” he said loudly, 
before anyone could interrupt him again. 

He had expected more muttering, but the silence that 
fell seemed to be somehow denser than before. 

“Dementors?” said Madam Bones after a moment, 
raising her thick eyebrows so that her monocle looked 
in danger of falling out. “What do you mean, boy?” 

“I mean there were two dementors down that alleyway 
and they went for me and my cousin!” 

“Ah,” said Fudge again, smirking unpleasantly as he 
looked around at the Wizengamot, as though inviting 
them to share the joke. “Yes. Yes, I thought we’d be 
hearing something like this.” 

“Dementors in Little Whinging?” Madam Bones said 
in tones of great surprise. “I don’t understand — ” 

“Don’t you, Amelia?” said Fudge, still smirking. “Let 
me explain. He’s been thinking it through and decided 
dementors would make a very nice little cover story, 
very nice indeed. Muggles can’t see dementors, can 
they, boy? Highly convenient, highly convenient ... so 
it’s just your word and no witnesses...” 

“I’m not lying!” said Harry loudly, over another 
outbreak of muttering from the court. “There were two 
of them, coming from opposite ends of the alley, 

Page | 182Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




everything went dark and cold and my cousin felt 
them and ran for it — ” 

“Enough, enough!” said Fudge with a very 
supercilious look on his face. “I’m sorry to interrupt 
what I’m sure would have been a very well-rehearsed 
story — ” 

Dumbledore cleared his throat. The Wizengamot fell 
silent again. 

“We do, in fact, have a witness to the presence of 
dementors in that alleyway,” he said, “other than 
Dudley Dursley, I mean.” 

Fudge’s plump face seemed to slacken, as though 
somebody had let air out of it. He stared down at 
Dumbledore for a moment or two, then, with the 
appearance of a man pulling himself back together, 
said, “We haven’t got time to listen to more 
taradiddles, I’m afraid, Dumbledore. I want this dealt 
with quickly — ” 

“I may be wrong,” said Dumbledore pleasantly, “but I 
am sure that under the Wizengamot Charter of 
Rights, the accused has the right to present witnesses 
for his or her case? Isn’t that the policy of the 
Department of Magical Law Enforcement, Madam 
Bones?” he continued, addressing the witch in the 
monocle. 

“True,” said Madam Bones. “Perfectly true.” 

“Oh, very well, very well,” snapped Fudge. “Where is 
this person?” 

“I brought her with me,” said Dumbledore. “She’s just 
outside the door. Should I — ?” 



Page | 183Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“No — Weasley, you go,” Fudge barked at Percy, who 
got up at once, hurried down the stone steps from the 
judge’s balcony, and hastened past Dumbledore and 
Harry without glancing at them. 

A moment later, Percy returned, followed by Mrs. 

Figg. She looked scared and more batty than ever. 
Harry wished she had thought to change out of her 
carpet slippers. 

Dumbledore stood up and gave Mrs. Figg his chair, 
conjuring a second one for himself. 

“Full name?” said Fudge loudly, when Mrs. Figg had 
perched herself nervously on the very edge of her 
seat. 

“Arabella Doreen Figg,” said Mrs. Figg in her quavery 
voice. 

“And who exactly are you?” said Fudge, in a bored 
and lofty voice. 

“I’m a resident of Little Whinging, close to where 
Harry Potter lives,” said Mrs. Figg. 

“We have no record of any witch or wizard living in 
Little Whinging other than Harry Potter,” said Madam 
Bones at once. “That situation has always been 
closely monitored, given ... given past events.” 

“I’m a Squib,” said Mrs. Figg. “So you wouldn’t have 
me registered, would you?” 

“A Squib, eh?” said Fudge, eyeing her suspiciously. 
“We’ll be checking that. You’ll leave details of your 
parentage with my assistant, Weasley. Incidentally, 
can Squibs see dementors?” he added, looking left 
and right along the bench where he sat. 

Page | 184Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Yes, we can!” said Mrs. Figg indignantly. 



Fudge looked back down at her, his eyebrows raised. 
“Very well,” he said coolly. “What is your story?” 

“I had gone out to buy cat food from the corner shop 
at the end of Wisteria Walk, shortly after nine on the 
evening of the second of August,” gabbled Mrs. Figg at 
once, as though she had learned what she was saying 
by heart, “when I heard a disturbance down the 
alleyway between Magnolia Crescent and Wisteria 
Walk. On approaching the mouth of the alleyway I 
saw dementors running — ” 

“Running?” said Madam Bones sharply. “Dementors 
don’t run, they glide.” 

“That’s what I meant to say,” said Mrs. Figg quickly, 
patches of pink appearing in her withered cheeks. 
“Gliding along the alley toward what looked like two 
boys.” 

“What did they look like?” said Madam Bones, 
narrowing her eyes so that the monocle’s edges 
disappeared into her flesh. 

“Well, one was very large and the other one rather 
skinny — ” 

“No, no,” said Madam Bones impatiently, “the 
dementors ... describe them.” 

“Oh,” said Mrs. Figg, the pink flush creeping up her 
neck now. “They were big. Big and wearing cloaks.” 

Harry felt a horrible sinking in the pit of his stomach. 
Whatever Mrs. Figg said to the contrary, it sounded to 
him as though the most she had ever seen was a 
picture of a dementor, and a picture could never 

Page | 185Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




convey the truth of what these beings were like: the 
eerie way they moved, hovering inches over the 
ground, or the rotting smell of them, or that terrible, 
rattling noise they made as they sucked on the 
surrounding air ... A dumpy wizard with a large black 
mustache in the second row leaned close to his 
neighbor, a frizzy-haired witch, and whispered 
something in her ear. She smirked and nodded. 

“Big and wearing cloaks,” repeated Madam Bones 
coolly, while Fudge snorted derisively. “I see. Anything 
else?” 

“Yes,” said Mrs. Figg. “I felt them. Everything went 
cold, and this was a very warm summer’s night, mark 
you. And I felt ... as though all happiness had gone 
from the world . . . and I remembered . . . dreadful 
things...” 

Her voice shook and died. 

Madam Bones’ eyes widened slightly. Harry could see 
red marks under her eyebrow where the monocle had 
dug into it. 

“What did the dementors do?” she asked, and Harry 
felt a rush of hope. 

“They went for the boys,” said Mrs. Figg, her voice 
stronger and more confident now, the pink flush 
ebbing away from her face. “One of them had fallen. 
The other was backing away, trying to repel the 
dementor. That was Harry. He tried twice and 
produced silver vapor. On the third attempt, he 
produced a Patronus, which charged down the first 
dementor and then, with his encouragement, chased 
away the second from his cousin. And that ... that 
was what happened,” Mrs. Figg finished, somewhat 
lamely. 

Page | 186Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Madam Bones looked down at Mrs. Figg in silence; 
Fudge was not looking at her at all, but fidgeting with 
his papers. Finally he raised his eyes and said, rather 
aggressively “That’s what you saw, is it?” 

“That was what happened,” Mrs. Figg repeated. 

“Very well,” said Fudge. “You may go.” 

Mrs. Figg cast a frightened look from Fudge to 
Dumbledore, then got up and shuffled off toward the 
door again. Harry heard it thud shut behind her. 

“Not a very convincing witness,” said Fudge loftily. 

“Oh, I don’t know,” said Madam Bones in her 
booming voice. “She certainly described the effects of 
a dementor attack very accurately. And I can’t 
imagine why she would say they were there if they 
weren’t — ” 

“But dementors wandering into a Muggle suburb and 
just happening to come across a wizard?” snorted 
Fudge. “The odds on that must be very, very long, 
even Bagman wouldn’t have bet — ” 

“Oh, I don’t think any of us believe the dementors 
were there by coincidence,” said Dumbledore lightly. 

The witch sitting to the right of Fudge with her face in 
shadow moved slightly, but everyone else was quite 
still and silent. 

“And what is that supposed to mean?” asked Fudge 
icily. 

“It means that I think they were ordered there,” said 
Dumbledore. 



Page | 187Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“I think we might have a record of it if someone had 
ordered a pair of dementors to go strolling through 
Little Whinging!” barked Fudge. 

“Not if the dementors are taking orders from someone 
other than the Ministry of Magic these days,” said 
Dumbledore calmly. “I have already given you my 
views on this matter, Cornelius.” 

“Yes, you have,” said Fudge forcefully, “and I have no 
reason to believe that your views are anything other 
than bilge, Dumbledore. The dementors remain in 
place in Azkaban and are doing everything we ask 
them to.” 

“Then,” said Dumbledore, quietly but clearly, “we 
must ask ourselves why somebody within the 
Ministry ordered a pair of dementors into that 
alleyway on the second of August.” 

In the complete silence that greeted these words, the 
witch to the right of Fudge leaned forward so that 
Harry saw her for the first time. 

He thought she looked just like a large, pale toad. She 
was rather squat with a broad, flabby face, as little 
neck as Uncle Vernon, and a very wide, slack mouth. 
Her eyes were large, round, and slightly bulging. Even 
the little black velvet bow perched on top of her short 
curly hair put him in mind of a large fly she was 
about to catch on a long sticky tongue. 

“The Chair recognizes Dolores Jane Umbridge, Senior 
Undersecretary to the Minister,” said Fudge. 

The witch spoke in a fluttery, girlish, high-pitched 
voice that took Harry aback; he had been expecting a 
croak. 



Page | 188Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“I’m sure I must have misunderstood you, Professor 
Dumbledore,” she said with a simper that left her big, 
round eyes as cold as ever. “So silly of me. But it 
sounded for a teensy moment as though you were 
suggesting that the Ministry of Magic had ordered an 
attack on this boy!” 

She gave a silvery laugh that made the hairs on the 
back of Harry’s neck stand up. A few other members 
of the Wizengamot laughed with her. It could not have 
been plainer that not one of them was really amused. 

“If it is true that the dementors are taking orders only 
from the Ministry of Magic, and it is also true that two 
dementors attacked Harry and his cousin a week ago, 
then it follows logically that somebody at the Ministry 
might have ordered the attacks,” said Dumbledore 
politely. “Of course, these particular dementors may 
have been outside Ministry control — ” 

“There are no dementors outside Ministry control!” 
snapped Fudge, who had turned brick red. 

Dumbledore inclined his head in a little bow. 

“Then undoubtedly the Ministry will be making a full 
inquiry into why two dementors were so very far from 
Azkaban and why they attacked without 
authorization.” 

“It is not for you to decide what the Ministry of Magic 
does or does not do, Dumbledore!” snapped Fudge, 
now a shade of magenta of which Uncle Vernon would 
have been proud. 

“Of course it isn’t,” said Dumbledore mildly. “I was 
merely expressing my confidence that this matter will 
not go uninvestigated.” 



Page | 189Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




He glanced at Madam Bones, who readjusted her 
monocle and stared back at him, frowning slightly. 

“I would remind everybody that the behavior of these 
dementors, if indeed they are not figments of this 
boy’s imagination, is not the subject of this hearing!” 
said Fudge. “We are here to examine Harry Potter’s 
offenses under the Decree for the Reasonable 
Restriction of Underage Sorcery!” 

“Of course we are,” said Dumbledore, “but the 
presence of dementors in that alleyway is highly 
relevant. Clause seven of the Decree states that magic 
may be used before Muggles in exceptional 
circumstances, and as those exceptional 
circumstances include situations that threaten the 
life of the wizard or witch himself, or witches, wizards, 
or Muggles present at the time of the — ” 

“We are familiar with clause seven, thank you very 
much!” snarled Fudge. 

“Of course you are,” said Dumbledore courteously. 
“Then we are in agreement that Harry’s use of the 
Patronus Charm in these circumstances falls 
precisely into the category of exceptional 
circumstances it describes?” 

“If there were dementors, which I doubt — ” 

“You have heard from an eyewitness,” Dumbledore 
interrupted. “If you still doubt her truthfulness, call 
her back, question her again. I am sure she would not 
object.” 

“I — that — not — ” blustered Fudge, fiddling with the 
papers before him. “It’s — I want this over with today, 
Dumbledore!” 



Page | 190Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“But naturally, you would not care how many times 
you heard from a witness, if the alternative was a 
serious miscarriage of justice,” said Dumbledore. 

“Serious miscarriage, my hat!” said Fudge at the top 
of his voice. “Have you ever bothered to tot up the 
number of cock-and-bull stories this boy has come 
out with, Dumbledore, while trying to cover up his 
flagrant misuse of magic out of school? I suppose 
you’ve forgotten the Hover Charm he used three years 
ago -” 

“That wasn’t me, it was a house-elf!” said Harry. 

“YOU SEE?” roared Fudge, gesturing flamboyantly in 
Harry’s direction. “A house-elf! In a Muggle house! I 
ask you — ” 

“The house-elf in question is currently in the employ 
of Hogwarts School,” said Dumbledore. “I can 
summon him here in an instant to give evidence if 
you wish.” 

“I — not — I haven’t got time to listen to house-elves! 
Anyway, that’s not the only — he blew up his aunt, 
for God’s sake!” Fudge shouted, banging his fist on 
the judge’s bench and upsetting a bottle of ink. 

“And you very kindly did not press charges on that 
occasion, accepting, I presume, that even the best 
wizards cannot always control their emotions,” said 
Dumbledore calmly, as Fudge attempted to scrub the 
ink off his notes. 

“And I haven’t even started on what he gets up to at 
school — ” 

“ — but as the Ministry has no authority to punish 
Hogwarts students for misdemeanors at school, 

Page | 191Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Harry’s behavior there is not relevant to this inquiry,” 
said Dumbledore, politely as ever, but now with a 
suggestion of coolness behind his words. 

“Oho!” said Fudge. “Not our business what he does at 
school, eh? You think so?” 

“The Ministry does not have the power to expel 
Hogwarts students, Cornelius, as I reminded you on 
the night of the second of August,” said Dumbledore. 
“Nor does it have the right to confiscate wands until 
charges have been successfully proven, again, as I 
reminded you on the night of the second of August. In 
your admirable haste to ensure that the law is 
upheld, you appear, inadvertently I am sure, to have 
overlooked a few laws yourself.” 

“Laws can be changed,” said Fudge savagely. 

“Of course they can,” said Dumbledore, inclining his 
head. “And you certainly seem to be making many 
changes, Cornelius. Why, in the few short weeks 
since I was asked to leave the Wizengamot, it has 
already become the practice to hold a full criminal 
trial to deal with a simple matter of underage magic!” 

A few of the wizards above them shifted 
uncomfortably in their seats. Fudge turned a slightly 
deeper shade of puce. The toadlike witch on his right, 
however, merely gazed at Dumbledore, her face quite 
expressionless. 

“As far as I am aware, however,” Dumbledore 
continued, “there is no law yet in place that says this 
court’s job is to punish Harry for every bit of magic he 
has ever performed. He has been charged with a 
specific offense and he has presented his defense. All 
he and I can do now is to await your verdict.” 



Page | 192Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Dumbledore put his fingertips together again and said 
no more. Fudge glared at him, evidently incensed. 
Harry glanced sideways at Dumbledore, seeking 
reassurance; he was not at all sure that Dumbledore 
was right in telling the Wizengamot, in effect, that it 
was about time they made a decision. Again, however, 
Dumbledore seemed oblivious to Harry’s attempt to 
catch his eye. He continued to look up at the benches 
where the entire Wizengamot had fallen into urgent, 
whispered conversations. 

Harry looked at his feet. His heart, which seemed to 
have swollen to an unnatural size, was thumping 
loudly under his ribs. He had expected the hearing to 
last longer than this. He was not at all sure that he 
had made a good impression. He had not really said 
very much. He ought to have explained more fully 
about the dementors, about how he had fallen over, 
about how both he and Dudley had nearly been 
kissed... 

Twice he looked up at Fudge and opened his mouth to 
speak, but his swollen heart was now constricting his 
air passages and both times he merely took a deep 
breath and looked back at his shoes. 

Then the whispering stopped. Harry wanted to look 
up at the judges, but found that it was really much, 
much easier to keep examining his laces. 

“Those in favor of clearing the accused of all 
charges?” said Madam Bones ’s booming voice. 

Harry’s head jerked upward. There were hands in the 
air, many of them . . . more than half! Breathing very 
fast, he tried to count, but before he could finish 
Madam Bones had said, “And those in favor of 
conviction?” 



Page | 193Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Fudge raised his hand; so did half a dozen others, 
including the witch on his right and the heavily 
mustached wizard and the frizzy-haired witch in the 
second row. 

Fudge glanced around at them all, looking as though 
there was something large stuck in his throat, then 
lowered his own hand. He took two deep breaths and 
then said, in a voice distorted by suppressed rage, 
“Very well, very well ... cleared of all charges.” 

“Excellent,” said Dumbledore briskly, springing to his 
feet, pulling out his wand, and causing the two chintz 
armchairs to vanish. “Well, I must be getting along. 
Good day to you all.” 

And without looking once at Harry, he swept from the 
dungeon. 



Page | 194Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 






THE WOES OF MRS. WEASLEY 

Dumbledore’s abrupt departure took Harry 
completely by surprise. He remained sitting where he 
was in the chained chair, struggling with his feelings 
of shock and relief. The Wizengamot were all getting 
to their feet, talking, and gathering up their papers 
and packing them away. Harry stood up. Nobody 
seemed to be paying him the slightest bit of attention 
except the toadlike witch on Fudge’s right, who was 
now gazing down at him instead of at Dumbledore. 
Ignoring her, he tried to catch Fudge’s eye, or Madam 
Bones’s, wanting to ask whether he was free to go, 
but Fudge seemed quite determined not to notice 
Harry, and Madam Bones was busy with her 
briefcase, so he took a few tentative steps toward the 
exit and when nobody called him back, broke into a 
very fast walk. 

He took the last few steps at a run, wrenched open 
the door, and almost collided with Mr. Weasley, who 
was standing right outside, looking pale and 
apprehensive. 



Page | 195Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 



“Dumbledore didn’t say — ” 



“Cleared,” Harry said, pulling the door closed behind 
him, “of all charges!” 

Beaming, Mr. Weasley seized Harry by the shoulders. 

“Harry, that’s wonderful! Well, of course, they couldn’t 
have found you guilty, not on the evidence, but even 
so, I can’t pretend I wasn’t — ” 

But Mr. Weasley broke off, because the courtroom 
door had just opened again. The Wizengamot were 
filing out. 

“Merlin’s beard,” said Mr. Weasley wonderingly, 
pulling Harry aside to let them all pass, “you were 
tried by the full court?” 

“I think so,” said Harry quietly. 

One or two of the passing wizards nodded to Harry as 
they passed and a few, including Madam Bones, said, 
“Morning, Arthur,” to Mr. Weasley, but most averted 
their eyes. Cornelius Fudge and the toadlike witch 
were almost the last to leave the dungeon. Fudge 
acted as though Mr. Weasley and Harry were part of 
the wall, but again, the witch looked almost 
appraisingly at Harry as she passed. Last of all to 
pass was Percy. Like Fudge, he completely ignored his 
father and Harry; he marched past clutching a large 
roll of parchment and a handful of spare quills, his 
back rigid and his nose in the air. The lines around 
Mr. Weasley’s mouth tightened slightly, but other 
than this he gave no sign that he had noticed his 
third son. 

“I’m going to take you straight back so you can tell 
the others the good news,” he said, beckoning Harry 

Page | 196Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




forward as Percy’s heels disappeared up the stairs to 
the ninth level. I’ll drop you off on the way to that 
toilet in Bethnal Green. Come on...” 



“So what will you have to do about the toilet?” Harry 
asked, grinning. Everything suddenly seemed five 
times funnier than usual. It was starting to sink in: 
He was cleared, he was going hack to Hogwarts. 

“Oh, it’s a simple enough anti-jinx,” said Mr. Weasley 
as they mounted the stairs, “but it’s not so much 
having to repair the damage, it’s more the attitude 
behind the vandalism, Harry. Muggle-baiting might 
strike some wizards as funny, but it’s an expression 
of something much deeper and nastier, and I for one 



Mr. Weasley broke off in mid-sentence. They had just 
reached the ninth-level corridor, and Cornelius Fudge 
was standing a few feet away from them, talking 
quietly to a tall man with sleek blond hair and a 
pointed, pale face. 

The second man turned at the sound of their 
footsteps. He too broke off in mid-conversation, his 
cold gray eyes narrowed and fixed upon Harry’s face. 

“Well, well, well ... Patronus Potter,” said Lucius 
Malfoy coolly. 

Harry felt winded, as though he had just walked into 
something heavy. He had last seen those cool gray 
eyes through slits in a Death Eater’s hood, and last 
heard that man’s voice jeering in a dark graveyard 
while Lord Voldemort tortured him. He could not 
believe that Lucius Malfoy dared look him in the face; 
he could not believe that he was here, in the Ministry 
of Magic, or that Cornelius Fudge was talking to him, 



Page | 197Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




when Harry had told Fudge mere weeks ago that 
Malfoy was a Death Eater. 

“The Minister was just telling me about your lucky 
escape, Potter,” drawled Mr. Malfoy. “Quite 
astonishing, the way you continue to wriggle out of 
very tight holes... Snakelike, in fact ...” 

Mr. Weasley gripped Harry’s shoulder in warning. 

“Yeah,” said Harry, “yeah, I’m good at escaping...” 

Lucius Malfoy raised his eyes to Mr. Weasley’s face. 

“And Arthur Weasley too! What are you doing here, 
Arthur?” 

“I work here,” said Mr. Weasley shortly. 

“Not here, surely?” said Mr. Malfoy, raising his 
eyebrows and glancing toward the door over Mr. 
Weasley’s shoulder. “I thought you were up on the 
second floor. . . Don’t you do something that involves 
sneaking Muggle artifacts home and bewitching 
them?” 

“No,” said Mr. Weasley curtly, his fingers now biting 
into Harry’s shoulder. 

“What are you doing here anyway?” Harry asked 
Lucius Malfoy. 

“I don’t think private matters between myself and the 
Minister are any concern of yours, Potter,” said 
Malfoy, smoothing the front of his robes; Harry 
distinctly heard the gentle clinking of what sounded 
like a full pocket of gold. “Really, just because you are 
Dumbledore’s favorite boy, you must not expect the 



Page | 198Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




same indulgence from the rest of us... Shall we go up 
to your office, then, Minister?” 

“Certainly,” said Fudge, turning his back on Harry 
and Mr. Weasley. “This way, Lucius.” 

They strode off together, talking in low voices. Mr. 
Weasley did not let go of Harry’s shoulder until they 
had disappeared into the lift. 

“Why wasn’t he waiting outside Fudge’s office if 
they’ve got business to do together?” Harry burst out 
furiously. “What was he doing down here?” 

“Trying to sneak down to the courtroom, if you ask 
me,” said Mr. Weasley, looking extremely agitated as 
he glanced over his shoulder as though making sure 
they could not be overheard. “Trying to find out 
whether you’d been expelled or not. I’ll leave a note 
for Dumbledore when I drop you off, he ought to 
know Malfoy’s been talking to Fudge again.” 

“What private business have they got together 
anyway?” 

“Gold, I expect,” said Mr. Weasley angrily. “Malfoy’s 
been giving generously to all sorts of things for 
years... Gets him in with the right people ... then he 
can ask favors ... delay laws he doesn’t want passed 
... Oh, he’s very well connected, Lucius Malfoy...” 

The lift arrived; it was empty except for a flock of 
memos that flapped around Mr. Weasley’s head as he 
pressed the button for the Atrium and the doors 
clanged shut; he waved them away irritably. 

“Mr. Weasley,” said Harry slowly, “if Fudge is meeting 
Death Eaters like Malfoy, if he’s seeing them alone, 



Page | 199Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




how do we know they haven’t put the Imperius Curse 
on him?” 

“Don’t think it hadn’t occurred to us, Harry,” 
muttered Mr. Weasley. “But Dumbledore thinks 
Fudge is acting of his own accord at the moment — 
which, as Dumbledore says, is not a lot of comfort... 
Best not talk about it anymore just now, Harry...” 

The doors slid open and they stepped out into the 
now almost-deserted Atrium. Eric the security man 
was hidden behind his Daily Prophet again. They had 
walked straight past the golden fountain before Harry 
remembered. 

“Wait...” he told Mr. Weasley, and pulling his money 
bag from his pocket, he turned back to the fountain. 

He looked up into the handsome wizard’s face, but up 
close, Harry thought he looked rather weak and 
foolish. The witch was wearing a vapid smile like a 
beauty contestant, and from what Harry knew of 
goblins and centaurs, they were most unlikely to be 
caught staring this soppily at humans of any 
description. Only the house-elf’s attitude of creeping 
servility looked convincing. With a grin at the thought 
of what Hermione would say if she could see the 
statue of the elf, Harry turned his money bag upside 
down and emptied not just ten Galleons, but the 
whole contents into the pool at the statues’ feet. 

“I knew it!” yelled Ron, punching the air. “You always 
get away with stuff!” 

“They were bound to clear you,” said Hermione, who 
had looked positively faint with anxiety when Harry 
had entered the kitchen and was now holding a 
shaking hand over her eyes. “There was no case 
against you, none at all...” 

Page | 200Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Everyone seems quite relieved, though, considering 
they all knew I’d get off,” said Harry, smiling. 

Mrs. Weasley was wiping her face on her apron, and 
Fred, George, and Ginny were doing a kind of war 
dance to a chant that went “He got off, he got off he 
got off — ” 

“That’s enough, settle down!” shouted Mr. Weasley, 
though he too was smiling. “Listen, Sirius, Lucius 
Malfoy was at the Ministry — ” 

“What?” said Sirius sharply. 

“He got off he got off he got off — ” 

“Be quiet, you three! Yes, we saw him talking to 
Fudge on level nine, then they went up to Fudge’s 
office together. Dumbledore ought to know.” 

“Absolutely,” said Sirius. “We’ll tell him, don’t worry.” 

“Well, I’d better get going, there’s a vomiting toilet in 
Bethnal Green waiting for me. Molly, I’ll be late, I’m 
covering for Tonks, but Kingsley might be dropping in 
for dinner — ” 

“He got off he got off he got off — ” 

“That’s enough — Fred — George — Ginny!” said Mrs. 
Weasley, as Mr. Weasley left the kitchen. “Harry dear, 
come and sit down, have some lunch, you hardly ate 
breakfast...” 

Ron and Hermione sat themselves down opposite him 
looking happier than they had done since he had first 
arrived at number twelve, Grimmauld Place, and 
Harry’s feeling of giddy relief, which had been 
somewhat dented by his encounter with Lucius 
Page | 201Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Malfoy, swelled again. The gloomy house seemed 
warmer and more welcoming all of a sudden; even 
Kreacher looked less ugly as he poked his snoutlike 
nose into the kitchen to investigate the source of all 
the noise. 

“ ’Course, once Dumbledore turned up on your side, 
there was no way they were going to convict you,” 
said Ron happily, now dishing great mounds of 
mashed potatoes onto everyone’s plates. 

“Yeah, he swung it for me,” said Harry. He felt that it 
would sound highly ungrateful, not to mention 
childish, to say, “I wish he’d talked to me, though. Or 
even looked at me.” 

And as he thought this, the scar on his forehead 
burned so badly that he clapped his hand to it. 

“What’s up?” said Hermione, looking alarmed. 

“Scar,” Harry mumbled. “But it’s nothing... It happens 
all the time now...” 

None of the others had noticed a thing; all of them 
were now helping themselves to food while gloating 
over Harry’s narrow escape; Fred, George, and Ginny 
were still singing. Hermione looked rather anxious, 
but before she could say anything, Ron said happily, 

“I bet Dumbledore turns up this evening to celebrate 
with us, you know.” 

“I don’t think he’ll be able to, Ron,” said Mrs. Weasley, 
setting a huge plate of roast chicken down in front of 
Harry. “He’s really very busy at the moment.” 

“HE GOT OFF, HE GOT OFF, HE GOT OFF—” 

“SHUT UP!” roared Mrs. Weasley. 

Page | 202Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Over the next few days Harry could not help noticing 
that there was one person within number twelve, 
Grimmauld Place, who did not seem wholly overjoyed 
that he would be returning to Hogwarts. Sirius had 
put up a very good show of happiness on first hearing 
the news, wringing Harry’s hand and beaming just 
like the rest of them; soon, however, he was moodier 
and surlier than before, talking less to everybody, 
even Harry, and spending increasing amounts of time 
shut up in his mother’s room with Buckbeak. 

“Don’t you go feeling guilty!” said Hermione sternly, 
after Harry had confided some of his feelings to her 
and Ron while they scrubbed out a moldy cupboard 
on the third floor a few days later. “You belong at 
Hogwarts and Sirius knows it. Personally, I think he’s 
being selfish.” 

“That’s a bit harsh, Hermione,” said Ron, frowning as 
he attempted to prize off a bit of mold that had 
attached itself firmly to his finger, “you wouldn’t want 
to be stuck inside this house without company.” 

“He’ll have company!” said Hermione. “It’s 
headquarters to the Order of the Phoenix, isn’t it? He 
just got his hopes up that Harry would be coming to 
live here with him.” 

“I don’t think that’s true,” said Harry, wringing out 
his cloth. “He wouldn’t give me a straight answer 
when I asked him if I could.” 

“He just didn’t want to get his own hopes up even 
more,” said Hermione wisely. “And he probably felt a 
bit guilty himself, because I think a part of him was 
really hoping you’d be expelled. Then you’d both be 
outcasts together.” 



Page | 203Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Come off it!” said Harry and Ron together, but 
Hermione merely shrugged. 

“Suit yourselves. But I sometimes think Ron’s mum’s 
right, and Sirius gets confused about whether you’re 
you or your father, Harry.” 

“So you think he’s touched in the head?” said Harry 
heatedly. 

“No, I just think he’s been very lonely for a long time,” 
said Hermione simply. 

At this point Mrs. Weasley entered the bedroom 
behind them. 

“Still not finished?” she said, poking her head into the 
cupboard. 

“I thought you might be here to tell us to have a 
break!” said Ron bitterly. “D’you know how much 
mold we’ve got rid of since we arrived here?” 

“You were so keen to help the Order,” said Mrs. 
Weasley, “you can do your bit by making 
headquarters fit to live in.” 

“I feel like a house-elf,” grumbled Ron. 

“Well, now that you understand what dreadful lives 
they lead, perhaps you’ll be a bit more active in 
S.P.E.W.!” said Hermione hopefully, as Mrs. Weasley 
left them to it again. “You know, maybe it wouldn’t be 
a bad idea to show people exactly how horrible it is to 
clean all the time — we could do a sponsored scrub of 
Gryffindor common room, all proceeds to S.P.E.W., it 
would raise awareness as well as funds — ” 



Page | 204Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“I’ll sponsor you to shut up about spew,” Ron 
muttered irritably, but only so Harry could hear him. 

Harry found himself daydreaming about Hogwarts 
more and more as the end of the holidays 
approached; he could not wait to see Hagrid again, to 
play Quidditch, even to stroll across the vegetable 
patches to the Herbology greenhouses. It would be a 
treat just to leave this dusty, musty house, where half 
of the cupboards were still bolted shut and Kreacher 
wheezed insults out of the shadows as you passed, 
though Harry was careful not to say any of this within 
earshot of Sirius. 

The fact was that living at the headquarters of the 
anti-Voldemort movement was not nearly as 
interesting or exciting as Harry would have expected 
before he’d experienced it. Though members of the 
Order of the Phoenix came and went regularly, 
sometimes staying for meals, sometimes only for a few 
minutes’ whispered conversation, Mrs. Weasley made 
sure that Harry and the others were kept well out of 
earshot (whether Extendable or normal) and nobody, 
not even Sirius, seemed to feel that Harry needed to 
know anything more than he had heard on the night 
of his arrival. 

On the very last day of the holidays Harry was 
sweeping up Hedwig’s owl droppings from the top of 
the wardrobe when Ron entered their bedroom 
carrying a couple of envelopes. 

“Booklists have arrived,” he said, throwing one of the 
envelopes up to Harry, who was standing on a chair. 
“About time, I thought they’d forgotten, they usually 
come much earlier than this...” 

Harry swept the last of the droppings into a rubbish 
bag and threw the bag over Ron’s head into the 

Page | 205Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




wastepaper basket in the corner, which swallowed it 
and belched loudly. He then opened his letter: It 
contained two pieces of parchment, one the usual 
reminder that term started on the first of September, 
the other telling him which books he would need for 
the coming year. 

“Only two new ones,” he said, reading the list. “The 
Standard Book of Spells, Grade 5, by Miranda 
Goshawk and Defensive Magical Theory, by Wilbert 
Slinkhard.” 

Crack. 

Fred and George Apparated right beside Harry. He 
was so used to them doing this by now that he didn’t 
even fall off his chair. 

“We were just wondering who assigned the Slinkhard 
book,” said Fred conversationally. 

“Because it means Dumbledore’s found a new 
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher,” said George. 

“And about time too,” said Fred. 

“What d’you mean?” Harry asked, jumping down 
beside them. 

“Well, we overheard Mum and Dad talking on the 
Extendable Ears a few weeks back,” Fred told Harry, 
“and from what they were saying, Dumbledore was 
having real trouble finding anyone to do the job this 
year.” 

“Not surprising, is it, when you look at what’s 
happened to the last four?” said George. 



Page | 206Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“One sacked, one dead, one’s memory removed, and 
one locked in a trunk for nine months,” said Harry, 
counting them off on his fingers. “Yeah, I see what 
you mean.” 

“What’s up with you, Ron?” asked Fred. 

Ron did not answer. Harry looked around. Ron was 
standing very still with his mouth slightly open, 
gaping at his letter from Hogwarts. 

“What’s the matter?” said Fred impatiently, moving 
around Ron to look over his shoulder at the 
parchment. 

Fred’s mouth fell open too. 

“Prefect?” he said, staring incredulously at the letter. 
“Prefect?” 

George leapt forward, seized the envelope in Ron’s 
other hand, and turned it upside down. Harry saw 
something scarlet and gold fall into George’s palm. 

“No way,” said George in a hushed voice. 

“There’s been a mistake,” said Fred, snatching the 
letter out of Ron’s grasp and holding it up to the light 
as though checking for a watermark. “No one in their 
right mind would make Ron a prefect...” 

The twins’ heads turned in unison and both of them 
stared at Harry. 

“We thought you were a cert!” said Fred in a tone that 
suggested Harry had tricked them in some way. 

“We thought Dumbledore was bound to pick you!” 
said George indignantly. 

Page | 207Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Winning the Triwizard and everything!” said Fred. 

“I suppose all the mad stuff must’ve counted against 
him,” said George to Fred. 

“Yeah,” said Fred slowly. “Yeah, you’ve caused too 
much trouble, mate. Well, at least one of you’s got 
their priorities right.” 

He strode over to Harry and clapped him on the back 
while giving Ron a scathing look. 

“Prefect ... ickle Ronnie the prefect ...” 

“Oh, Mum’s going to be revolting,” groaned George, 
thrusting the prefect badge back at Ron as though it 
might contaminate him. 

Ron, who still had not said a word, took the badge, 
stared at it for a moment, and then held it out to 
Harry as though asking mutely for confirmation that 
it was genuine. Harry took it. A large P was 
superimposed on the Gryffindor lion. He had seen a 
badge just like this on Percy’s chest on his very first 
day at Hogwarts. 

The door banged open. Hermione came tearing into 
the room, her cheeks flushed and her hair flying. 
There was an envelope in her hand. 

“Did you — did you get — ?” 

She spotted the badge in Harry’s hand and let out a 
shriek. 

“I knew it!” she said excitedly, brandishing her letter. 
“Me too, Harry, me too!” 



Page | 208Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“No,” said Harry quickly, pushing the badge back into 
Ron’s hand. “It’s Ron, not me.” 



“It — what?” 

“Ron’s prefect, not me,” Harry said. 

“Ron?” said Hermione, her jaw dropping. “But ... are 
you sure? I mean — ” 

She turned red as Ron looked around at her with a 
defiant expression on his face. 

“It’s my name on the letter,” he said. 

“I ...” said Hermione, looking thoroughly bewildered. 

“I ... well ... wow! Well done, Ron! That’s really — ” 

“Unexpected,” said George, nodding. 

“No,” said Hermione, blushing harder than ever, “no, 
it’s not ... Ron’s done loads of ... he’s really ...” 

The door behind her opened a little wider and Mrs. 
Weasley backed into the room carrying a pile of 
freshly laundered robes. 

“Ginny said the booklists had come at last,” she said, 
glancing around at all the envelopes as she made her 
way over to the bed and started sorting the robes into 
two piles. “If you give them to me I’ll take them over to 
Diagon Alley this afternoon and get your books while 
you’re packing. Ron, I’ll have to get you more 
pajamas, these are at least six inches too short, I 
can’t believe how fast you’re growing ... what color 
would you like?” 

“Get him red and gold to match his badge,” said 
George, smirking. 

Page | 209Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Match his what?” said Mrs. Weasley absently, rolling 
up a pair of maroon socks and placing them on Ron’s 
pile. 

“His badge,” said Fred, with the air of getting the 
worst over quickly. “His lovely shiny new prefect’s 
badge.” 

Fred’s words took a moment to penetrate Mrs. 
Weasley’s preoccupation about pajamas. 

“His ... but ... Ron, you’re not... ?” 

Ron held up his badge. 

Mrs. Weasley let out a shriek just like Hermione’s. 

“I don’t believe it! I don’t believe it! Oh, Ron, how 
wonderful! A prefect! That’s everyone in the family!” 

“What are Fred and I, next-door neighbors?” said 
George indignantly, as his mother pushed him aside 
and flung her arms around her youngest son. 

“Wait until your father hears! Ron, I’m so proud of 
you, what wonderful news, you could end up Head 
Boy just like Bill and Percy, it’s the first step! Oh, 
what a thing to happen in the middle of all this worry, 
I’m just thrilled, oh Ronnie — ” 

Fred and George were both making loud retching 
noises behind her back but Mrs. Weasley did not 
notice; arms tight around Ron’s neck, she was kissing 
him all over his face, which had turned a brighter 
scarlet than his badge. 

“Mum ... don’t ... Mum, get a grip...” he muttered, 
trying to push her away. 



Page | 210Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




She let go of him and said breathlessly, “Well, what 
will it be? We gave Percy an owl, but you’ve already 
got one, of course.” 

“W-what do you mean?” said Ron, looking as though 
he did not dare believe his ears. 

“You’ve got to have a reward for this!” said Mrs. 
Weasley fondly. “How about a nice new set of dress 
robes?” 

“We’ve already bought him some,” said Fred sourly, 
who looked as though he sincerely regretted this 
generosity. 

“Or a new cauldron, Charlie’s old one’s rusting 
through, or a new rat, you always liked Scabbers — ” 

“Mum,” said Ron hopefully, “can I have a new 
broom?” 

Mrs. Weasley’s face fell slightly; broomsticks were 
expensive. 

“Not a really good one!” Ron hastened to add. “Just — 
just a new one for a change ...” 

Mrs. Weasley hesitated, then smiled. 

“Of course you can... Well, I’d better get going if I’ve 
got a broom to buy too. I’ll see you all later... Little 
Ronnie, a prefect! And don’t forget to pack your 
trunks... A prefect ... Oh, I’m all of a dither!” 

She gave Ron yet another kiss on the cheek, sniffed 
loudly, and bustled from the room. 

Fred and George exchanged looks. 



Page | 211Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“You don’t mind if we don’t kiss you, do you, Ron?” 
said Fred in a falsely anxious voice. 

“We could curtsy, if you like,” said George. 

“Oh, shut up,” said Ron, scowling at them. 

“Or what?” said Fred, an evil grin spreading across 
his face. “Going to put us in detention?” 

“I’d love to see him try,” sniggered George. 

“He could if you don’t watch out!” said Hermione 
angrily, at which Fred and George burst out laughing 
and Ron muttered, “Drop it, Hermione.” 

“We’re going to have to watch our step, George,” said 
Fred, pretending to tremble, “with these two on our 
case...” 

“Yeah, it looks like our law-breaking days are finally 
over,” said George, shaking his head. 

And with another loud crack, the twins Disapparated. 

“Those two!” said Hermione furiously, staring up at 
the ceiling, through which they could now hear Fred 
and George roaring with laughter in the room 
upstairs. “Don’t pay any attention to them, Ron, 
they’re only jealous!” 

“I don’t think they are,” said Ron doubtfully, also 
looking up at the ceiling. “They’ve always said only 
prats become prefects... Still,” he added on a happier 
note, “they’ve never had new brooms! I wish I could go 
with Mum and choose... She’ll never be able to afford 
a Nimbus, but there’s the new Cleansweep out, that’d 
be great... Yeah, I think I’ll go and tell her I like the 
Cleansweep, just so she knows...” 

Page | 212Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




He dashed from the room, leaving Harry and 
Hermione alone. 

For some reason, Harry found that he did not want to 
look at Hermione. He turned to his bed, picked up the 
pile of clean robes Mrs. Weasley had laid upon it, and 
crossed the room to his trunk. 

“Harry?” said Hermione tentatively. 

“Well done,” said Harry, so heartily it did not sound 
like his voice at all, and still not looking at her. 
“Brilliant. Prefect. Great.” 

“Thanks,” said Hermione. “Erm — Harry — could I 
borrow Hedwig so I can tell Mum and Dad? They’ll be 
really pleased — I mean, prefect is something they 
can understand — ” 

“Yeah, no problem,” said Harry, still in the horrible 
hearty voice that did not belong to him. “Take her!” 

He leaned over his trunk, laid the robes on the 
bottom of it, and pretended to be rummaging for 
something while Hermione crossed to the wardrobe 
and called Hedwig down. A few moments passed; 
Harry heard the door close but remained bent double, 
listening; the only sounds he could hear were the 
blank picture on the wall sniggering again and the 
wastepaper basket in the corner coughing up the owl 
droppings. 

He straightened up and looked behind him. Hermione 
and Hedwig had gone. Harry returned slowly to his 
bed and sank onto it, gazing unseeingly at the foot of 
the wardrobe. 

He had forgotten completely about prefects being 
chosen in the fifth year. He had been too anxious 

Page | 213Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




about the possibility of being expelled to spare a 
thought for the fact that badges must be winging their 
way toward certain people. But if he had remembered 
... if he had thought about it . . . what would he have 
expected? 

Not this, said a small and truthful voice inside his 
head. 

Harry screwed up his face and buried it in his hands. 
He could not lie to himself; if he had known the 
prefect badge was on its way, he would have expected 
it to come to him, not Ron. Did this make him as 
arrogant as Draco Malfoy? Did he think himself 
superior to everyone else? Did he really believe he was 
better than Ron? 

No, said the small voice defiantly. 

Was that true? Harry wondered, anxiously probing 
his own feelings. 

I’m better at Quidditch, said the voice. But I’m not 
better at anything else. 

That was definitely true, Harry thought; he was no 
better than Ron in lessons. But what about outside 
lessons? What about those adventures he, Ron, and 
Hermione had had together since they had started at 
Hogwarts, often risking much worse than expulsion? 

Well, Ron and Hermione were with me most of the 
time, said the voice in Harry’s head. 

Not all the time, though, Harry argued with himself. 
They didn’t fight Quirrell with me. They didn’t take on 
Riddle and the basilisk. They didn’t get rid of all those 
dementors the night Sirius escaped. They weren’t in 
that graveyard with me, the night Voldemort returned... 
Page | 214Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




And the same feeling of ill usage that had 
overwhelmed him on the night he had arrived rose 
again. I’ve definitely done more, Harry thought 
indignantly. I’ve done more than either of them\ 

But maybe, said the small voice fairly, maybe 
Dumbledore doesn’t choose prefects because they’ve 
got themselves into a load of dangerous situations... 
Maybe he chooses them for other reasons... Ron must 
have something you don’t... 

Harry opened his eyes and stared through his fingers 
at the wardrobe’s clawed feet, remembering what Fred 
had said. 

“No one in their right mind would make Ron a 
prefect...” 

Harry gave a small snort of laughter. A second later 
he felt sickened with himself. 

Ron had not asked Dumbledore to give him the 
prefect badge. This was not Ron’s fault. Was he, 

Harry, Ron’s best friend in the world, going to sulk 
because he didn’t have a badge, laugh with the twins 
behind Ron’s back, ruin this for Ron when, for the 
first time, he had beaten Harry at something? 

At this point Harry heard Ron’s footsteps on the stairs 
again. He stood up, straightened his glasses, and 
hitched a grin onto his face as Ron bounded back 
through the door. 

“Just caught her!” he said happily. “She says she’ll 
get the Cleansweep if she can.” 

“Cool,” Harry said, and he was relieved to hear that 
his voice had stopped sounding hearty. “Listen — Ron 
— well done, mate.” 

Page | 215Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




The smile faded off Ron’s face. 



“I never thought it would be me!” he said, shaking his 
head, “I thought it would be you!” 

“Nah, I’ve caused too much trouble,” Harry said, 
echoing Fred. 

“Yeah,” said Ron, “yeah, I suppose... Well, we’d better 
get our trunks packed, hadn’t we?” 

It was odd how widely their possessions seemed to 
have scattered themselves since they had arrived. It 
took them most of the afternoon to retrieve their 
books and belongings from all over the house and 
stow them back inside their school trunks. Harry 
noticed that Ron kept moving his prefect’s badge 
around, first placing it on his bedside table, then 
putting it into his jeans pocket, then taking it out and 
laying it on his folded robes, as though to see the 
effect of the red on the black. Only when Fred and 
George dropped in and offered to attach it to his 
forehead with a Permanent Sticking Charm did he 
wrap it tenderly in his maroon socks and lock it in his 
trunk. 

Mrs. Weasley returned from Diagon Alley around six 
o’clock, laden with books and carrying a long package 
wrapped in thick brown paper that Ron took from her 
with a moan of longing. 

“Never mind unwrapping it now, people are arriving 
for dinner, I want you all downstairs,” she said, but 
the moment she was out of sight Ron ripped off the 
paper in a frenzy and examined every inch of his new 
broom, an ecstatic expression on his face. 

Down in the basement Mrs. Weasley had hung a 
scarlet banner over the heavily laden dinner table, 

Page | 216Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




which read CONGRATULATIONS RON AND 
HERMIONE — NEW PREFECTS. She looked in a 
better mood than Harry had seen her all holiday. 

“I thought we’d have a little party, not a sit-down 
dinner,” she told Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, 
and Ginny as they entered the room. “Your father and 
Bill are on their way, Ron, I’ve sent them both owls 
and they’re thrilled,” she added, beaming. 

Fred rolled his eyes. 

Sirius, Lupin, Tonks, and Kingsley Shacklebolt were 
already there and Mad-Eye Moody stumped in shortly 
after Harry had got himself a butterbeer. 

“Oh, Alastor, I am glad you’re here,” said Mrs. 

Weasley brightly, as Mad-Eye shrugged off his 
traveling cloak. “We’ve been wanting to ask you for 
ages — could you have a look in the writing desk in 
the drawing room and tell us what’s inside it? We 
haven’t wanted to open it just in case it’s something 
really nasty.” 

“No problem, Molly ...” 

Moody’s electric-blue eye swiveled upward and stared 
fixedly through the ceiling of the kitchen. 

“Drawing room ...” he growled, as the pupil 
contracted. “Desk in the corner? Yeah, I see it... Yeah, 
it’s a boggart... Want me to go up and get rid of it, 
Molly?” 

“No, no, I’ll do it myself later,” beamed Mrs. Weasley. 
“You have your drink. We’re having a little bit of a 
celebration, actually...” She gestured at the scarlet 
banner. “Fourth prefect in the family!” she said 
fondly, ruffling Ron’s hair. 

Page | 217Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Prefect, eh?” growled Moody, his normal eye on Ron 
and his magical eye swiveling around to gaze into the 
side of his head. Harry had the very uncomfortable 
feeling it was looking at him and moved away toward 
Sirius and Lupin. 

“Well, congratulations,” said Moody, still glaring at 
Ron with his normal eye, “authority figures always 
attract trouble, but I suppose Dumbledore thinks you 
can withstand most major jinxes or he wouldn’t have 
appointed you...” 

Ron looked rather startled at this view of the matter 
but was saved the trouble of responding by the arrival 
of his father and eldest brother. Mrs. Weasley was in 
such a good mood she did not even complain that 
they had brought Mundungus with them too; he was 
wearing a long overcoat that seemed oddly lumpy in 
unlikely places and declined the offer to remove it and 
put it with Moody’s traveling cloak. 

“Well, I think a toast is in order,” said Mr. Weasley, 
when everyone had a drink. He raised his goblet. “To 
Ron and Hermione, the new Gryffindor prefects!” 

Ron and Hermione beamed as everyone drank to 
them and then applauded. 

“I was never a prefect myself,” said Tonks brightly 
from behind Harry as everybody moved toward the 
table to help themselves to food. Her hair was tomato- 
red and waist length today; she looked like Ginny’s 
older sister. “My Head of House said I lacked certain 
necessary qualities.” 

“Like what?” said Ginny, who was choosing a baked 
potato. 

“Like the ability to behave myself,” said Tonks. 

Page | 218Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Ginny laughed; Hermione looked as though she did 
not know whether to smile or not and compromised 
by taking an extra large gulp of butterbeer and 
choking on it. 

“What about you, Sirius?” Ginny asked, thumping 
Hermione on the back. 

Sirius, who was right beside Harry, let out his usual 
barklike laugh. 

“No one would have made me a prefect, I spent too 
much time in detention with James. Lupin was the 
good boy, he got the badge.” 

“I think Dumbledore might have hoped that I would 
be able to exercise some control over my best friends,” 
said Lupin. “I need scarcely say that I failed dismally.” 

Harry’s mood suddenly lifted. His father had not been 
a prefect either. All at once the party seemed much 
more enjoyable; he loaded up his plate, feeling 
unusually fond of everyone in the room. 

Ron was rhapsodizing about his new broom to 
anybody who would listen. 

"... naught to seventy in ten seconds, not bad, is it? 
When you think the Comet Two Ninety’s only naught 
to sixty and that’s with a decent tailwind according to 
Which Broomstick?” 

Hermione was talking very earnestly to Lupin about 
her view of elf rights. 

“I mean, it’s the same kind of nonsense as werewolf 
segregation, isn’t it? It all stems from this horrible 
thing wizards have of thinking they’re superior to 
other creatures...” 

Page | 219Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Mrs. Weasley and Bill were having their usual 
argument about Bill’s hair. 

"... getting really out of hand, and you’re so good- 
looking, it would look much better shorter, wouldn’t 
it, Harry?” 

“Oh — I dunno — ” said Harry, slightly alarmed at 
being asked his opinion; he slid away from them in 
the direction of Fred and George, who were huddled 
in a corner with Mundungus. 

Mundungus stopped talking when he saw Harry, but 
Fred winked and beckoned Harry closer. 

“It’s okay,” he told Mundungus, “we can trust Harry, 
he’s our financial backer.” 

“Look what Dung’s gotten us,” said George, holding 
out his hand to Harry. It was full of what looked like 
shriveled black pods. A faint rattling noise was 
coming from them, even though they were completely 
stationary. 

“Venomous Tentacula seeds,” said George. “We need 
them for the Skiving Snackboxes but they’re a Class 
C Non-Tradeable Substance so we’ve been having a 
bit of trouble getting hold of them.” 

“Ten Galleons the lot, then, Dung?” said Fred. 

“Wiv all the trouble I went to to get ’em?” said 
Mundungus, his saggy, bloodshot eyes stretching 
even wider. “I’m sorry, lads, but I’m not taking a Knut 
under twenty.” 

“Dung likes his little joke,” Fred said to Harry. 



Page | 220Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Yeah, his best one so far has been six Sickles for a 
bag of knarl quills,” said George. 

“Be careful,” Harry warned them quietly. 

“What?” said Fred. “Mum’s busy cooing over Prefect 
Ron, we’re okay.” 

“But Moody could have his eye on you,” Harry pointed 
out. 

Mundungus looked nervously over his shoulder. 

“Good point, that,” he grunted. “All right, lads, ten it 
is, if you’ll take ’em quick.” 

“Cheers, Harry!” said Fred delightedly, when 
Mundungus had emptied his pockets into the twins’ 
outstretched hands and scuttled off toward the food. 
“We’d better get these upstairs...” 

Harry watched them go, feeling slightly uneasy. It had 
just occurred to him that Mr. and Mrs. Weasley would 
want to know how Fred and George were financing 
their joke shop business when, as was inevitable, 
they finally found out about it. Giving the twins his 
Tri-wizard winnings had seemed a simple thing to do 
at the time, but what if it led to another family row 
and a Percy-like estrangement? Would Mrs. Weasley 
still feel that Harry was as good as her son if she 
found out he had made it possible for Fred and 
George to start a career she thought quite 
unsuitable? 

Standing where the twins had left him with nothing 
but a guilty weight in the pit of his stomach for 
company, Harry caught the sound of his own name. 
Kingsley Shacklebolt’s deep voice was audible even 
over the surrounding chatter. 

Page | 221Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




"... why Dumbledore didn’t make Potter a prefect?” 
said Kingsley. 

“He’ll have had his reasons,” replied Lupin. 

“But it would’ve shown confidence in him. It’s what 
I’d’ve done,” persisted Kingsley, “ ’specially with the 
Daily Prophet having a go at him every few days...” 

Harry did not look around; he did not want Lupin or 
Kingsley to know he had heard. He followed 
Mundungus back toward the table, though not 
remotely hungry. His pleasure in the party had 
evaporated as quickly as it had come; he wished he 
were upstairs in bed. 

Mad-Eye Moody was sniffing at a chicken leg with 
what remained of his nose; evidently he could not 
detect any trace of poison, because he then tore a 
strip off it with his teeth. 

"... the handle’s made of Spanish oak with anti-jinx 
varnish and in-built vibration control — ” Ron was 
saying to Tonks. 

Mrs. Weasley yawned widely. 

“Well, I think I’ll sort out that boggart before I turn 
in... Arthur, I don’t want this lot up too late, all right? 
’Night, Harry, dear.” 

She left the kitchen. Harry set down his plate and 
wondered whether he could follow her without 
attracting attention. 

“You all right, Potter?” grunted Moody. 

“Yeah, fine,” lied Harry. 



Page | 222Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Moody took a swig from his hip flask, his electric blue 
eye staring sideways at Harry. 

“Come here, I’ve got something that might interest 
you,” he said. 

From an inner pocket of his robes Moody pulled a 
very tattered old Wizarding photograph. 

“Original Order of the Phoenix,” growled Moody. 
“Found it last night when I was looking for my spare 
Invisibility Cloak, seeing as Podmore hasn’t had the 
manners to return my best one... Thought people 
might like to see it.” 

Harry took the photograph. A small crowd of people, 
some waving at him, others lifting their glasses, 
looked back up at him. 

“There’s me,” said Moody unnecessarily, pointing at 
himself. The Moody in the picture was unmistakable, 
though his hair was slightly less gray and his nose 
was intact. “And there’s Dumbledore beside me, 
Dedalus Diggle on the other side ... That’s Marlene 
McKinnon, she was killed two weeks after this was 
taken, they got her whole family. That’s Frank and 
Alice Longbottom — ” 

Harry’s stomach, already uncomfortable, clenched as 
he looked at Alice Longbottom; he knew her round, 
friendly face very well, even though he had never met 
her, because she was the image of her son, Neville. 

“Poor devils,” growled Moody. “Better dead than what 
happened to them ... and that’s Emmeline Vance, 
you’ve met her, and that there’s Lupin, obviously ... 
Benjy Fenwick, he copped it too, we only ever found 
bits of him ... shift aside there,” he added, poking the 
picture, and the little photographic people edged 
Page | 223Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




sideways, so that those who were partially obscured 
could move to the front. 



“That’s Edgar Bones ... brother of Amelia Bones, they 
got him and his family too, he was a great wizard ... 
Sturgis Podmore, blimey, he looks young ... Caradoc 
Dearborn, vanished six months after this, we never 
found his body ... Hagrid, of course, looks exactly the 
same as ever ... Elphias Doge, you’ve met him, I’d 
forgotten he used to wear that stupid hat . . . Gideon 
Prewett, it took five Death Eaters to kill him and his 
brother Fabian, they fought like heroes ... budge 
along, budge along ...” 

The little people in the photograph jostled among 
themselves, and those hidden right at the back 
appeared at the forefront of the picture. 

“That’s Dumbledore’s brother, Aberforth, only time I 
ever met him, strange bloke ... That’s Dorcas 
Meadowes, Voldemort killed her personally ... Sirius, 
when he still had short hair ... and ... there you go, 
thought that would interest you!” 

Harry’s heart turned over. His mother and father were 
beaming up at him, sitting on either side of a small, 
watery-eyed man Harry recognized at once as 
Wormtail: He was the one who had betrayed their 
whereabouts to Voldemort and so helped bring about 
their deaths. 

“Eh?” said Moody. 

Harry looked up into Moody’s heavily scarred and 
pitted face. Evidently Moody was under the 
impression he had just given Harry a bit of a treat. 

“Yeah,” said Harry, attempting to grin again. “Er ... 
listen, I’ve just remembered, I haven’t packed my ...” 

Page | 224Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




He was spared the trouble of inventing an object he 
had not packed; Sirius had just said, “What’s that 
you’ve got there, Mad-Eye?” and Moody had turned 
toward him. Harry crossed the kitchen, slipped 
through the door and up the stairs before anyone 
could call him back. 

He did not know why he had received such a shock; 
he had seen his parents’ pictures before, after all, and 
he had met Wormtail ... but to have them sprung on 
him like that, when he was least expecting it ... No 
one would like that, he thought angrily. . . 

And then, to see them surrounded by all those other 
happy faces ... Benjy Fenwick, who had been found in 
bits, and Gideon Prewett, who had died like a hero, 
and the Longbottoms, who had been tortured into 
madness ... all waving happily out of the photograph 
forevermore, not knowing that they were doomed... 
Well, Moody might find that interesting ... he, Harry, 
found it disturbing... 

Harry tiptoed up the stairs in the hall past the stuffed 
elf heads, glad to be on his own again, but as he 
approached the first landing he heard noises. 
Someone was sobbing in the drawing room. 

“Hello?” Harry said. 

There was no answer but the sobbing continued. He 
climbed the remaining stairs two at a time, walked 
across the landing, and opened the drawing-room 
door. 

Someone was cowering against the dark wall, her 
wand in her hand, her whole body shaking with sobs. 
Sprawled on the dusty old carpet in a patch of 
moonlight, clearly dead, was Ron. 



Page | 225Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




All the air seemed to vanish from Harry’s lungs; he 
felt as though he were falling through the floor; his 
brain turned icy cold — Ron dead, no, it couldn’t be 



But wait a moment, it couldn’t be — Ron was 
downstairs — 

“Mrs. Weasley?” Harry croaked. 

“ R-r-riddikulus\” Mrs. Weasley sobbed, pointing her 
shaking wand at Ron’s body. 

Crack. 

Ron’s body turned into Bill’s, spread-eagled on his 
back, his eyes wide open and empty. Mrs. Weasley 
sobbed harder than ever. 

“ R-riddikulus\” she sobbed again. 

Crack. 

Mr. Weasley’s body replaced Bill’s, his glasses askew, 
a trickle of blood running down his face. 

“No!” Mrs. Weasley moaned. “No ... riddikulus\ 
Riddikulusl RIDDIKULUSl” 

Crack. Dead twins. Crack. Dead Percy. Crack. Dead 
Harry ... 

“Mrs. Weasley, just get out of here!” shouted Harry, 
staring down at his own dead body on the floor. “Let 
someone else — ” 

“What’s going on?” 



Page | 226Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Lupin had come running into the room, closely 
followed by Sirius, with Moody stumping along behind 
them. Lupin looked from Mrs. Weasley to the dead 
Harry on the floor and seemed to understand in an 
instant. Pulling out his own wand he said, very firmly 
and clearly, “ RiddikulusV’ 

Harry’s body vanished. A silvery orb hung in the air 
over the spot where it had lain. Lupin waved his wand 
once more and the orb vanished in a puff of smoke. 

“Oh — oh — oh!” gulped Mrs. Weasley, and she broke 
into a storm of crying, her face in her hands. 

“Molly,” said Lupin bleakly, walking over to her, 

“Molly, don’t ...” 

Next second she was sobbing her heart out on Lupin’s 
shoulder. 

“Molly, it was just a boggart,” he said soothingly, 
patting her on the head. “Just a stupid boggart ...” 

“I see them d-d-dead all the time!” Mrs. Weasley 
moaned into his shoulder. “All the t-t-time! I d-d- 
dream about it ...” 

Sirius was staring at the patch of carpet where the 
boggart, pretending to be Harry’s body, had lain. 
Moody was looking at Harry, who avoided his gaze. He 
had a funny feeling Moody’s magical eye had followed 
him all the way out of the kitchen. 

“D-d-don’t tell Arthur,” Mrs. Weasley was gulping 
now, mopping her eyes frantically with her cuffs. “I d- 
d-don’t want him to know... Being silly ...” 

Lupin handed her a handkerchief and she blew her 
nose. 

Page | 227Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Harry, I’m so sorry, what must you think of me?” she 
said shakily. “Not even able to get rid of a boggart ...” 

“Don’t be stupid,” said Harry, trying to smile. 

“I’m just s-s-so worried,” she said, tears spilling out of 
her eyes again. “Half the f-f-family’s in the Order, it’ll 
b-b-be a miracle if we all come through this... and P- 
P-Percy’s not talking to us... What if something d-d- 
dreadful happens and we had never m-m-made up? 
And what’s going to happen if Arthur and I get killed, 
who’s g-g-going to look after Ron and Ginny?” 

“Molly, that’s enough,” said Lupin firmly. “This isn’t 
like last time. The Order is better prepared, we’ve got 
a head start, we know what Voldemort’s up to — ” 

Mrs. Weasley gave a little squeak of fright at the 
sound of the name. 

“Oh, Molly, come on, it’s about time you got used to 
hearing it — look, I can’t promise no one’s going to get 
hurt, nobody can promise that, but we’re much better 
off than we were last time, you weren’t in the Order 
then, you don’t understand, last time we were 
outnumbered twenty to one by the Death Eaters and 
they were picking us off one by one...” 

Harry thought of the photograph again, of his parents’ 
beaming faces. He knew Moody was still watching 
him. 

“Don’t worry about Percy,” said Sirius abruptly. “He’ll 
come round. It’s a matter of time before Voldemort 
moves into the open; once he does, the whole 
Ministry’s going to be begging us to forgive them. And 
I’m not sure I’ll be accepting their apology,” he added 
bitterly. 



Page | 228Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“And as for who’s going to look after Ron and Ginny if 
you and Arthur died,” said Lupin, smiling slightly, 
“what do you think we’d do, let them starve?” 

Mrs. Weasley smiled tremulously. 

“Being silly,” she muttered again, mopping her eyes. 

But Harry, closing his bedroom door behind him 
some ten minutes later, could not think Mrs. Weasley 
silly. He could still see his parents beaming up at him 
from the tattered old photograph, unaware that their 
lives, like so many of those around them, were 
drawing to a close. The image of the boggart posing as 
the corpse of each member of Mrs. Weasley’s family in 
turn kept flashing before his eyes. 

Without warning, the scar on his forehead seared 
with pain again and his stomach churned horribly. 

“Cut it out,” he said firmly, rubbing the scar as the 
pain receded again. 

“First sign of madness, talking to your own head,” 
said a sly voice from the empty picture on the wall. 

Harry ignored it. He felt older than he had ever felt in 
his life, and it seemed extraordinary to him that 
barely an hour ago he had been worried about a joke 
shop and who had gotten a prefect’s badge.

LUNA LOVEGOOD 

Harry had a troubled night’s sleep. His parents wove 
in and out of his dreams, never speaking; Mrs. 
Weasley sobbed over Kreacher’s dead body watched 
by Ron and Hermione, who were wearing crowns, and 
yet again Harry found himself walking down a 
corridor ending in a locked door. He awoke abruptly 
with his scar prickling to find Ron already dressed 
and talking to him. 

"... better hurry up, Mum’s going ballistic, she says 
we’re going to miss the train...” 

There was a lot of commotion in the house. From 
what he heard as he dressed at top speed, Harry 
gathered that Fred and George had bewitched their 
trunks to fly downstairs to save the bother of carrying 
them, with the result that they had hurtled straight 
into Ginny and knocked her down two flights of stairs 
into the hall; Mrs. Black and Mrs. Weasley were both 
screaming at the top of their voices. 



Page | 230Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 



COULD HAVE DONE HER A SERIOUS INJURY, 
YOU IDIOTS — ” 

FILTHY HALF-BREEDS, BESMIRCHING THE 
HOUSE OF MY FATHERS — ” 

Hermione came hurrying into the room looking 
flustered just as Harry was putting on his trainers; 
Hedwig was swaying on her shoulder, and she was 
carrying a squirming Crookshanks in her arms. 

“Mum and Dad just sent Hedwig back” — the owl 
fluttered obligingly over and perched on top of her 
cage — “are you ready yet?” 

“Nearly — Ginny all right?” Harry asked, shoving on 
his glasses. 

“Mrs. Weasley’s patched her up,” said Hermione. “But 
now Mad-Eye’s complaining that we can’t leave unless 
Sturgis Podmore’s here, otherwise the guard will be 
one short.” 

“Guard?” said Harry. “We have to go to King’s Cross 
with a guard?” 

“ You have to go to King’s Cross with a guard,” 
Hermione corrected him. 

“Why?” said Harry irritably. “I thought Voldemort was 
supposed to be lying low, or are you telling me he’s 
going to jump out from behind a dustbin to try and do 
me in?” 

“I don’t know, it’s just what Mad-Eye says,” said 
Hermione distractedly, looking at her watch. “But if 
we don’t leave soon we’re definitely going to miss the 
train...” 



Page | 231Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“WILL YOU LOT GET DOWN HERE NOW, PLEASE!” 
Mrs. Weasley bellowed and Hermione jumped as 
though scalded and hurried out of the room. Harry 
seized Hedwig, stuffed her unceremoniously into her 
cage, and set off downstairs after Hermione, dragging 
his trunk. 

Mrs. Black’s portrait was howling with rage but 
nobody was bothering to close the curtains over her; 
all the noise in the hall was bound to rouse her again 
anyway. 

“Harry, you’re to come with me and Tonks,” shouted 
Mrs. Weasley over the repeated screeches of 
“MUDBLOODSl SCUM CREATURES OF DIRV.” “Leave 
your trunk and your owl, Alastor’s going to deal with 
the luggage... Oh, for heaven’s sake, Sirius, 
Dumbledore said no!” 

A bearlike black dog had appeared at Harry’s side as 
Harry clambered over the various trunks cluttering 
the hall to get to Mrs. Weasley. 

“Oh honestly ...” said Mrs. Weasley despairingly, 
“well, on your own head be it!” 

She wrenched open the front door and stepped out 
into the weak September sunlight. Harry and the dog 
followed her. The door slammed behind them and 
Mrs. Black’s screeches were cut off instantly. 

“Where’s Tonks?” Harry said, looking around as they 
went down the stone steps of number twelve, which 
vanished the moment they reached the pavement. 

“She’s waiting for us just up here,” said Mrs. Weasley 
stiffly, averting her eyes from the lolloping black dog 
beside Harry. 



Page | 232Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




An old woman greeted them on the corner. She had 
tightly curled gray hair and wore a purple hat shaped 
like a porkpie. 

“Wotcher, Harry,” she said, winking. “Better hurry up, 
hadn’t we, Molly?” she added, checking her watch. 

“I know, I know,” moaned Mrs. Weasley, lengthening 
her stride, “but Mad-Eye wanted to wait for Sturgis... 
If only Arthur could have got us cars from the 
Ministry again ... but Fudge wouldn’t let him borrow 
so much as an empty ink bottle these days... How 
Muggles can stand traveling without magic ...” 

But the great black dog gave a joyful bark and 
gamboled around them, snapping at pigeons, and 
chasing its own tail. Harry couldn’t help laughing. 
Sirius had been trapped inside for a very long time. 
Mrs. Weasley pursed her lips in an almost Aunt 
Petunia-ish way. 

It took them twenty minutes to reach King’s Cross by 
foot and nothing more eventful happened during that 
time than Sirius scaring a couple of cats for Harry’s 
entertainment. Once inside the station they lingered 
casually beside the barrier between platforms nine 
and ten until the coast was clear, then each of them 
leaned against it in turn and fell easily through onto 
platform nine and three quarters, where the Hogwarts 
Express stood belching sooty steam over a platform 
packed with departing students and their families. 
Harry inhaled the familiar smell and felt his spirits 
soar. . . He was really going back. . . 

“I hope the others make it in time,” said Mrs. Weasley 
anxiously, staring behind her at the wrought-iron 
arch spanning the platform, through which new 
arrivals would come. 



Page | 233Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Nice dog, Harry!” called a tall boy with dreadlocks. 

“Thanks, Lee,” said Harry, grinning, as Sirius wagged 
his tail frantically. 

“Oh good,” said Mrs. Weasley, sounding relieved, 
“here’s Alas tor with the luggage, look ...” 

A porter’s cap pulled low over his mismatched eyes, 
Moody came limping through the archway pushing a 
cart full of their trunks. 

“All okay,” he muttered to Mrs. Weasley and Tonks. 
“Don’t think we were followed...” 

Seconds later, Mr. Weasley emerged onto the platform 
with Ron and Hermione. They had almost unloaded 
Moody’s luggage cart when Fred, George, and Ginny 
turned up with Lupin. 

“No trouble?” growled Moody. 

“Nothing,” said Lupin. 

“I’ll still be reporting Sturgis to Dumbledore,” said 
Moody. “That’s the second time he’s not turned up in 
a week. Getting as unreliable as Mundungus.” 

“Well, look after yourselves,” said Lupin, shaking 
hands all round. He reached Harry last and gave him 
a clap on the shoulder. “You too, Harry. Be careful.” 

“Yeah, keep your head down and your eyes peeled,” 
said Moody, shaking Harry’s hand too. “And don’t 
forget, all of you — careful what you put in writing. If 
in doubt, don’t put it in a letter at all.” 



Page | 234Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“It’s been great meeting all of you,” said Tonks, 
hugging Hermione and Ginny. “We’ll see you soon, I 
expect.” 

A warning whistle sounded; the students still on the 
platform started hurrying onto the train. 

“Quick, quick,” said Mrs. Weasley distractedly, 
hugging them at random and catching Harry twice. 
“Write... Be good... If you’ve forgotten anything we’ll 
send it on... Onto the train, now, hurry...” 

For one brief moment, the great black dog reared onto 
its hind legs and placed its front paws on Harry’s 
shoulders, but Mrs. Weasley shoved Harry away 
toward the train door hissing, “For heaven’s sake act 
more like a dog, Sirius!” 

“See you!” Harry called out of the open window as the 
train began to move, while Ron, Hermione, and Ginny 
waved beside him. The figures of Tonks, Lupin, 

Moody, and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley shrank rapidly but 
the black dog was bounding alongside the window, 
wagging its tail; blurred people on the platform were 
laughing to see it chasing the train, and then they 
turned the corner, and Sirius was gone. 

“He shouldn’t have come with us,” said Hermione in a 
worried voice. 

“Oh lighten up,” said Ron, “he hasn’t seen daylight for 
months, poor bloke.” 

“Well,” said Fred, clapping his hands together, “can’t 
stand around chatting all day, we’ve got business to 
discuss with Lee. See you later,” and he and George 
disappeared down the corridor to the right. 



Page | 235Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




The train was gathering still more speed, so that the 
houses outside the window flashed past and they 
swayed where they stood. 

“Shall we go and find a compartment, then?” Harry 
asked Ron and Hermione. 

Ron and Hermione exchanged looks. 

“Er,” said Ron. 

“We’re — well — Ron and I are supposed to go into 
the prefect carriage,” Hermione said awkwardly. 

Ron wasn’t looking at Harry; he seemed to have 
become intensely interested in the fingernails on his 
left hand. 

“Oh,” said Harry. “Right. Fine.” 

“I don’t think we’ll have to stay there all journey,” said 
Hermione quickly. “Our letters said we just get 
instructions from the Head Boy and Girl and then 
patrol the corridors from time to time.” 

“Fine,” said Harry again. “Well, I-I might see you later, 
then.” 

“Yeah, definitely,” said Ron, casting a shifty, anxious 
look at Harry. “It’s a pain having to go down there, I’d 
rather — but we have to — I mean, I’m not enjoying 
it, I’m not Percy,” he finished defiantly. 

“I know you’re not,” said Harry and he grinned. But 
as Hermione and Ron dragged their trunks, 
Crookshanks, and a caged Pigwidgeon off toward the 
engine end of the train, Harry felt an odd sense of 
loss. He had never traveled on the Hogwarts Express 
without Ron.

“Come on,” Ginny told him, “if we get a move on we’ll 
be able to save them places.” 

“Right,” said Harry, picking up Hedwig’s cage in one 
hand and the handle of his trunk in the other. They 
struggled off down the corridor, peering through the 
glass-paneled doors into the compartments they 
passed, which were already full. Harry could not help 
noticing that a lot of people stared back at him with 
great interest and that several of them nudged their 
neighbors and pointed him out. After he had met this 
behavior in five consecutive carriages he remembered 
that the Daily Prophet had been telling its readers all 
summer what a lying show-off he was. He wondered 
bleakly whether the people now staring and 
whispering believed the stories. 

In the very last carriage they met Neville Longbottom, 
Harry’s fellow fifth-year Gryffindor, his round face 
shining with the effort of pulling his trunk along and 
maintaining a one-handed grip on his struggling toad, 
Trevor. 

“Hi, Harry,” he panted. “Hi, Ginny... Everywhere ’s 
full... I can’t find a seat...” 

“What are you talking about?” said Ginny, who had 
squeezed past Neville to peer into the compartment 
behind him. “There’s room in this one, there’s only 
Loony Lovegood in here — ” 

Neville mumbled something about not wanting to 
disturb anyone. 

“Don’t be silly,” said Ginny, laughing, “she’s all right.” 

She slid the door open and pulled her trunk inside it. 
Harry and Neville followed. 



Page | 237Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Hi, Luna,” said Ginny. “Is it okay if we take these 
seats?” 

The girl beside the window looked up. She had 
straggly, waist-length, dirty-blond hair, very pale 
eyebrows, and protuberant eyes that gave her a 
permanently surprised look. Harry knew at once why 
Neville had chosen to pass this compartment by. The 
girl gave off an aura of distinct dottiness. Perhaps it 
was the fact that she had stuck her wand behind her 
left ear for safekeeping, or that she had chosen to 
wear a necklace of butterbeer caps, or that she was 
reading a magazine upside down. Her eyes ranged 
over Neville and came to rest on Harry. She nodded. 

“Thanks,” said Ginny, smiling at her. 

Harry and Neville stowed the three trunks and 
Hedwig’s cage in the luggage rack and sat down. The 
girl called Luna watched them over her upside-down 
magazine, which was called The Quibbler. She did not 
seem to need to blink as much as normal humans. 

She stared and stared at Harry, who had taken the 
seat opposite her and now wished he had not. 

“Had a good summer, Luna?” Ginny asked. 

“Yes,” said Luna dreamily, without taking her eyes off 
Harry. “Yes, it was quite enjoyable, you know. You’re 
Harry Potter,” she added. 

“I know I am,” said Harry. 

Neville chuckled. Luna turned her pale eyes upon him 
instead. 

“And I don’t know who you are.” 

“I’m nobody,” said Neville hurriedly. 

Page | 238Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“No you’re not,” said Ginny sharply. “Neville 
Longbottom — Luna Lovegood. Luna’s in my year, but 
in Ravenclaw.” 

“ Wit beyond measure is man’s greatest treasure,” said 
Luna in a singsong voice. 

She raised her upside-down magazine high enough to 
hide her face and fell silent. Harry and Neville looked 
at each other with their eyebrows raised. Ginny 
suppressed a giggle. 

The train rattled onward, speeding them out into 
open country. It was an odd, unsettled sort of day; 
one moment the carriage was full of sunlight and the 
next they were passing beneath ominously gray 
clouds. 

“Guess what I got for my birthday?” said Neville. 

“Another Remembrall?” said Harry, remembering the 
marblelike device Neville’s grandmother had sent him 
in an effort to improve his abysmal memory. 

“No,” said Neville, “I could do with one, though, I lost 
the old one ages ago... No, look at this...” 

He dug the hand that was not keeping a firm grip on 
Trevor into his schoolbag and after a little bit of 
rummaging pulled out what appeared to be a small 
gray cactus in a pot, except that it was covered with 
what looked like boils rather than spines. 

“Mimbulus mimbletonia,” he said proudly. 

Harry stared at the thing. It was pulsating slightly, 
giving it the rather sinister look of some diseased 
internal organ. 



Page | 239Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“It’s really, really rare,” said Neville, beaming. “I don’t 
know if there’s one in the greenhouse at Hogwarts, 
even. I can’t wait to show it to Professor Sprout. My 
great-uncle Algie got it for me in Assyria. I’m going to 
see if I can breed from it.” 

Harry knew that Neville’s favorite subject was 
Herbology, but for the life of him he could not see 
what he would want with this stunted little plant. 

“Does it — er — do anything?” he asked. 

“Loads of stuff!” said Neville proudly. “It’s got an 
amazing defensive mechanism — hold Trevor for 
me...” 

He dumped the toad into Harry’s lap and took a quill 
from his schoolbag. Luna Lovegood’s popping eyes 
appeared over the top of her upside-down magazine 
again, watching what Neville was doing. Neville held 
the Mimbulus mimbletonia up to his eyes, his tongue 
between his teeth, chose his spot, and gave the plant 
a sharp prod with the tip of his quill. 

Liquid squirted from every boil on the plant, thick, 
stinking, dark-green jets of it; they hit the ceiling, the 
windows, and spattered Luna Lovegood’s magazine. 
Ginny, who had flung her arms up in front of her face 
just in time, merely looked as though she was 
wearing a slimy green hat, but Harry, whose hands 
had been busy preventing the escape of Trevor, 
received a face full. It smelled like rancid manure. 

Neville, whose face and torso were also drenched, 
shook his head to get the worst out of his eyes. 

“S-sorry,” he gasped. “I haven’t tried that before... 
Didn’t realize it would be quite so ... Don’t worry, 



Page | 240Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




though, Stinksap’s not poisonous,” he added 
nervously, as Harry spat a mouthful onto the floor. 



At that precise moment the door of their compartment 
slid open. 

“Oh ... hello, Harry,” said a nervous voice. “Um ... bad 
time?” 

Harry wiped the lenses of his glasses with his Trevor- 
free hand. A very pretty girl with long, shiny black 
hair was standing in the doorway smiling at him: Cho 
Chang, the Seeker on the Ravenclaw Quidditch team. 

“Oh ... hi,” said Harry blankly. 

“Um ...” said Cho. “Well ... just thought I’d say hello 
... ’bye then.” 

She closed the door again, rather pink in the face, 
and departed. Harry slumped back in his seat and 
groaned. He would have liked Cho to discover him 
sitting with a group of very cool people laughing their 
heads off at a joke he had just told; he would not 
have chosen to be sitting with Neville and Loony 
Lovegood, clutching a toad and dripping in Stinksap. 

“Never mind,” said Ginny bracingly. “Look, we can get 
rid of all this easily.” She pulled out her wand. 

“ Scour gif yY’ 

The Stinksap vanished. 

“Sorry,” said Neville again, in a small voice. 

Ron and Hermione did not turn up for nearly an 
hour, by which time the food trolley had already gone 
by. Harry, Ginny, and Neville had finished their 
Pumpkin Pasties and were busy swapping Chocolate 

Page | 241Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Frog cards when the compartment door slid open and 
they walked in, accompanied by Crookshanks and a 
shrilly hooting Pigwidgeon in his cage. 

“I’m starving,” said Ron, stowing Pigwidgeon next to 
Hedwig, grabbing a Chocolate Frog from Harry and 
throwing himself into the seat next to him. He ripped 
open the wrapper, bit off the Frog’s head, and leaned 
back with his eyes closed as though he had had a 
very exhausting morning. 

“Well, there are two fifth-year prefects from each 
House,” said Hermione, looking thoroughly 
disgruntled as she took her seat. “Boy and girl from 
each.” 

“And guess who’s a Slytherin prefect?” said Ron, still 
with his eyes closed. 

“Malfoy,” replied Harry at once, his worst fear 
confirmed. 

“ ’Course,” said Ron bitterly, stuffing the rest of the 
Frog into his mouth and taking another. 

“And that complete cow Pansy Parkinson,” said 
Hermione viciously. “How she got to be a prefect when 
she’s thicker than a concussed troll ...” 

“Who’s Hufflepuff?” Harry asked. 

“Ernie Macmillan and Hannah Abbott,” said Ron 
thickly. 

“And Anthony Goldstein and Padma Patil for 
Ravenclaw,” said Hermione. 

“You went to the Yule Ball with Padma Patil,” said a 
vague voice. 

Page | 242Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Everyone turned to look at Luna Lovegood, who was 
gazing un-blinkingly at Ron over the top of The 
Quibbler. He swallowed his mouthful of Frog. 

“Yeah, I know I did,” he said, looking mildly 
surprised. 

“She didn’t enjoy it very much,” Luna informed him. 
“She doesn’t think you treated her very well, because 
you wouldn’t dance with her. I don’t think I’d have 
minded,” she added thoughtfully, “I don’t like dancing 
very much.” 

She retreated behind The Quibbler again. Ron stared 
at the cover with his mouth hanging open for a few 
seconds, then looked around at Ginny for some kind 
of explanation, but Ginny had stuffed her knuckles in 
her mouth to stop herself giggling. Ron shook his 
head, bemused, then checked his watch. 

“We’re supposed to patrol the corridors every so 
often,” he told Harry and Neville, “and we can give out 
punishments if people are misbehaving. I can’t wait to 
get Crabbe and Goyle for something...” 

“You’re not supposed to abuse your position, Ron!” 
said Hermione sharply. 

“Yeah, right, because Malfoy won’t abuse it at all,” 
said Ron sarcastically. 

“So you’re going to descend to his level?” 

“No, I’m just going to make sure I get his mates before 
he gets mine.” 

“For heaven’s sake, Ron — ” 



Page | 243Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“I’ll make Goyle do lines, it’ll kill him, he hates 
writing,” said Ron happily. He lowered his voice to 
Goyle ’s low grunt and, screwing up his face in a look 
of pained concentration, mimed writing in midair. “I 
... must ... not ... look ... like ... a ... baboon’s ... 
backside...” 

Everyone laughed, but nobody laughed harder than 
Luna Lovegood. She let out a scream of mirth that 
caused Hedwig to wake up and flap her wings 
indignantly and Crookshanks to leap up into the 
luggage rack, hissing. She laughed so hard that her 
magazine slipped out of her grasp, slid down her legs, 
and onto the floor. 

“That was funny\” 

Her prominent eyes swam with tears as she gasped 
for breath, staring at Ron. Utterly nonplussed, he 
looked around at the others, who were now laughing 
at the expression on Ron’s face and at the ludicrously 
prolonged laughter of Luna Lovegood, who was 
rocking backward and forward, clutching her sides. 

“Are you taking the mickey?” said Ron, frowning at 
her. 

“Baboon’s ... backside!” she choked, holding her ribs. 

Everyone else was watching Luna laughing, but 
Harry, glancing at the magazine on the floor, noticed 
something that made him dive for it. Upside down it 
had been hard to tell what the picture on the front 
was, but Harry now realized it was a fairly bad 
cartoon of Cornelius Fudge; Harry only recognized 
him because of the lime-green bowler hat. One of 
Fudge’s hands was clenched around a bag of gold; the 
other hand was throttling a goblin. The cartoon was 
captioned: How Far Will Fudge Go to Gain Gringotts? 
Page | 244Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Beneath this were listed the titles of other articles 
inside the magazine. 

CORRUPTION IN THE QUIDDITCH LEAGUE: 

How the Tornados Are Taking Control 
SECRETS OF THE ANCIENT RUNES REVEALED 
SIRIUS BLACK: Villain or Victim? 

“Can I have a look at this?” Harry asked Luna eagerly. 

She nodded, still gazing at Ron, breathless with 
laughter. 

Harry opened the magazine and scanned the index; 
until this moment he had completely forgotten the 
magazine Kingsley had handed Mr. Weasley to give to 
Sirius, but it must have been this edition of The 
Quibbler. He found the page and turned excitedly to 
the article. 

This too was illustrated by a rather bad cartoon; in 
fact, Harry would not have known it was supposed to 
be Sirius if it hadn’t been captioned. Sirius was 
standing on a pile of human bones with his wand out. 
The headline on the article read: 

SIRIUS - Black As He’s Painted? 

Notorious Mass Murderer OR Innocent Singing 
Sensation? 

Harry had to read this sentence several times before 
he was convinced that he had not misunderstood it. 
Since when had Sirius been a singing sensation? 



Page | 245Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




For fourteen years Sirius Black has been believed 
guilty of the mass murder of twelve innocent Muggles 
and one wizard. Black’s audacious escape from 
Azkaban two years ago has led to the widest manhunt 
ever conducted by the Ministry of Magic. None of us 
has ever questioned that he deserves to be recaptured 
and handed back to the dementors. 

BUT DOES HE? 

Startling new evidence has recently come to light that 
Sirius Black may not have committed the crimes for 
which he was sent to Azkaban. In fact, says Doris 
Purkiss, of 18 Acanthia Way, Little Norton, Black may 
not even have been present at the killings. 

“What people don’t realize is that Sirius Black is a 
false name, ” says Mrs. Purkiss. “The man people 
believe to be Sirius Black is actually Stubby 
Boardman, lead singer of the popular singing group 
The Hobgoblins, who retired from public life after being 
struck in the ear by a turnip at a concert in Little 
Norton Church Hall nearly fifteen years ago. I 
recognized him the moment I saw his picture in the 
paper. Now, Stubby couldn’t possibly have committed 
those crimes, because on the day in question he 
happened to be enjoying a romantic candlelit dinner 
with me. I have written to the Minister of Magic and am 
expecting him to give Stubby, alias Sirius, a full pardon 
any day now. ” 

Harry finished reading and stared at the page in 
disbelief. Perhaps it was a joke, he thought, perhaps 
the magazine often printed spoof items. He flicked 
back a few pages and found the piece on Fudge. 

Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic, denied that 
he had any plans to take over the running of the 
Wizarding Bank, Gringotts, when he was elected 

Page | 246Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Minister of Magic five years ago. Fudge has always 
insisted that he wants nothing more than to 
“cooperate peacefully” with the guardians of our gold. 

BUT DOES HE? 

Sources close to the Minister have recently disclosed 
that Fudge’s dearest ambition is to seize control of the 
goblin gold supplies and that he will not hesitate to 
use force if need be. 

“It wouldn’t be the first time, either,” said a Ministry 
insider. “Cornelius ‘Goblin-Crusher’ Fudge, that’s what 
his friends call him, if you could hear him when he 
thinks no one’s listening, oh, he’s always talking about 
the goblins he’s had done in; he’s had them drowned, 
he’s had them dropped off buildings, he’s had them 
poisoned, he’s had them cooked in pies...” 



Harry did not read any further. Fudge might have 
many faults but Harry found it extremely hard to 
imagine him ordering goblins to be cooked in pies. He 
flicked through the rest of the magazine. Pausing 
every few pages he read an accusation that the 
Tutshill Tornados were winning the Quidditch League 
by a combination of blackmail, illegal broom- 
tampering, and torture; an interview with a wizard 
who claimed to have flown to the moon on a 
Cleansweep Six and brought back a bag of moon frogs 
to prove it; and an article on ancient runes, which at 
least explained why Luna had been reading The 
Quibbler upside down. According to the magazine, if 
you turned the runes on their heads they revealed a 
spell to make your enemy’s ears turn into kumquats. 
In fact, compared to the rest of the articles in The 
Quibbler, the suggestion that Sirius might really be 
the lead singer of The Hobgoblins was quite sensible. 
Page | 247Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Anything good in there?” asked Ron as Harry closed 
the magazine. 

“Of course not,” said Hermione scathingly, before 
Harry could answer, “ The Quibbler’s rubbish, 
everyone knows that.” 

“Excuse me,” said Luna; her voice had suddenly lost 
its dreamy quality. “My father’s the editor.” 

“I — oh,” said Hermione, looking embarrassed. “Well 
... it’s got some interesting ... I mean, it’s quite ...” 

“I’ll have it back, thank you,” said Luna coldly, and 
leaning forward she snatched it out of Harry’s hands. 
Rifling through it to page fifty-seven, she turned it 
resolutely upside down again and disappeared behind 
it, just as the compartment door opened for the third 
time. Harry looked around; he had expected this, but 
that did not make the sight of Draco Malfoy smirking 
at him from between his cronies Crabbe and Goyle 
any more enjoyable. 

“What?” he said aggressively, before Malfoy could 
open his mouth. 

“Manners, Potter, or I’ll have to give you a detention,” 
drawled Malfoy, whose sleek blond hair and pointed 
chin were just like his father’s. “You see, I, unlike 
you, have been made a prefect, which means that I, 
unlike you, have the power to hand out 
punishments.” 

“Yeah,” said Harry, “but you, unlike me, are a git, so 
get out and leave us alone.” 

Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and Neville laughed. Malfoy’s 
lip curled. 



Page | 248Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Tell me, how does it feel being second-best to 
Weasley, Potter?” he asked. 

“Shut up, Malfoy,” said Hermione sharply. 

“I seem to have touched a nerve,” said Malfoy, 
smirking. “Well, just watch yourself, Potter, because 
I’ll be dogging your footsteps in case you step out of 
line.” 

“Get out!” said Hermione, standing up. 

Sniggering, Malfoy gave Harry a last malicious look 
and departed, Crabbe and Goyle lumbering in his 
wake. Hermione slammed the compartment door 
behind them and turned to look at Harry, who knew 
at once that she, like him, had registered what Malfoy 
had said and been just as unnerved by it. 

“Chuck us another Frog,” said Ron, who had clearly 
noticed nothing. 

Harry could not talk freely in front of Neville and 
Luna. He exchanged another nervous look with 
Hermione and then stared out of the window. 

He had thought Sirius coming with him to the station 
was a bit of a laugh, but suddenly it seemed reckless, 
if not downright dangerous... Hermione had been 
right... Sirius should not have come. What if Mr. 
Malfoy had noticed the black dog and told Draco, 
what if he had deduced that the Weasleys, Lupin, 
Tonks, and Moody knew where Sirius was hiding? Or 
had Malfoy’s use of the word “dogging” been a 
coincidence? 

The weather remained undecided as they traveled 
farther and farther north. Rain spattered the windows 
in a halfhearted way, then the sun put in a feeble 

Page | 249Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




appearance before clouds drifted over it once more. 
When darkness fell and lamps came on inside the 
carriages, Luna rolled up The Quibbler, put it 
carefully away in her bag, and took to staring at 
everyone in the compartment instead. 

Harry was sitting with his forehead pressed against 
the train window, trying to get a first distant glimpse 
of Hogwarts, but it was a moonless night and the 
rain-streaked window was grimy. 

“We’d better change,” said Hermione at last. She and 
Ron pinned their prefect badges carefully to their 
chests. Harry saw Ron checking how it looked in the 
black window. 

At last the train began to slow down and they heard 
the usual racket up and down it as everybody 
scrambled to get their luggage and pets assembled, 
ready for departure. Ron and Hermione were 
supposed to supervise all this; they disappeared from 
the carriage again, leaving Harry and the others to 
look after Crookshanks and Pigwidgeon. 

“I’ll carry that owl, if you like,” said Luna to Harry, 
reaching out for Pigwidgeon as Neville stowed Trevor 
carefully in an inside pocket. 

“Oh — er — thanks,” said Harry, handing her the 
cage and hoisting Hedwig’s more securely into his 
arms. 

They shuffled out of the compartment feeling the first 
sting of the night air on their faces as they joined the 
crowd in the corridor. Slowly they moved toward the 
doors. Harry could smell the pine trees that lined the 
path down to the lake. He stepped down onto the 
platform and looked around, listening for the familiar 
call of “Firs’ years over here ... firs’ years ...” 

Page | 250Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




But it did not come. Instead a quite different voice, a 
brisk female one, was calling, “First years line up over 
here, please! All first years to me!” 

A lantern came swinging toward Harry and by its light 
he saw the prominent chin and severe haircut of 
Professor Grubbly-Plank, the witch who had taken 
over Hagrid ’s Care of Magical Creatures lessons for a 
while the previous year. 

“Where’s Hagrid?” he said out loud. 

“I don’t know,” said Ginny, “but we’d better get out of 
the way, we’re blocking the door.” 

“Oh yeah ...” 

Harry and Ginny became separated as they moved off 
along the platform and out through the station. 
Jostled by the crowd, Harry squinted through the 
darkness for a glimpse of Hagrid; he had to be here, 
Harry had been relying on it — seeing Hagrid again 
had been one of the things to which he had been 
looking forward most. But there was no sign of him at 
all. 

He can’t have left, Harry told himself as he shuffled 
slowly through a narrow doorway onto the road 
outside with the rest of the crowd. He’s just got a cold 
or something... 

He looked around for Ron or Hermione, wanting to 
know what they thought about the reappearance of 
Professor Grubbly-Plank, but neither of them was 
anywhere near him, so he allowed himself to be 
shunted forward onto the dark rain-washed road 
outside Hogsmeade station. 



Page | 251Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Here stood the hundred or so horseless stagecoaches 
that always took the students above first year up to 
the castle. Harry glanced quickly at them, turned 
away to keep a lookout for Ron and Hermione, then 
did a double take. 

The coaches were no longer horseless. There were 
creatures standing between the carriage shafts; if he 
had had to give them a name, he supposed he would 
have called them horses, though there was something 
reptilian about them, too. They were completely 
fleshless, their black coats clinging to their skeletons, 
of which every bone was visible. Their heads were 
dragonish, and their pupil-less eyes white and 
staring. Wings sprouted from each wither — vast, 
black leathery wings that looked as though they 
ought to belong to giant bats. Standing still and quiet 
in the gloom, the creatures looked eerie and sinister. 
Harry could not understand why the coaches were 
being pulled by these horrible horses when they were 
quite capable of moving along by themselves. 

“Where’s Pig?” said Ron’s voice, right behind Harry. 

“That Luna girl was carrying him,” said Harry, 
turning quickly, eager to consult Ron about Hagrid. 
“Where d’you reckon — ” 

“ — Hagrid is? I dunno,” said Ron, sounding worried. 
“He’d better be okay...” 

A short distance away, Draco Malfoy, followed by a 
small gang of cronies including Crabbe, Goyle, and 
Pansy Parkinson, was pushing some timid-looking 
second years out of the way so that they could get a 
coach to themselves. Seconds later Hermione emerged 
panting from the crowd. 



Page | 252Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Malfoy was being absolutely foul to a first year back 
there, I swear I’m going to report him, he’s only had 
his badge three minutes and he’s using it to bully 
people worse than ever... Where’s Crookshanks?” 

“Ginny’s got him,” said Harry. “There she is...” 

Ginny had just emerged from the crowd, clutching a 
squirming Crookshanks. 

“Thanks,” said Hermione, relieving Ginny of the cat. 
“Come on, let’s get a carriage together before they all 
fillup...” 

“I haven’t got Pig yet!” Ron said, but Hermione was 
already heading off toward the nearest unoccupied 
coach. Harry remained behind with Ron. 

“What are those things, d’you reckon?” he asked Ron, 
nodding at the horrible horses as the other students 
surged past them. 

“What things?” 

“Those horse — ” 

Luna appeared holding Pigwidgeon’s cage in her 
arms; the tiny owl was twittering excitedly as usual. 

“Here you are,” she said. “He’s a sweet little owl, isn’t 
he?” 

“Er ... yeah ... He’s all right,” said Ron gruffly. “Well, 
come on then, let’s get in... what were you saying, 
Harry?” 

“I was saying, what are those horse things?” Harry 
said, as he, Ron, and Luna made for the carriage in 
which Hermione and Ginny were already sitting. 

Page | 253Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“What horse things?” 



“The horse things pulling the carriages!” said Harry 
impatiently; they were, after all, about three feet from 
the nearest one; it was watching them with empty 
white eyes. Ron, however, gave Harry a perplexed 
look. 

“What are you talking about?” 

“I’m talking about — look!” 

Harry grabbed Ron’s arm and wheeled him about so 
that he was face-to-face with the winged horse. Ron 
stared straight at it for a second, then looked back at 
Harry. 

“What am I supposed to be looking at?” 

“At the — there, between the shafts! Harnessed to the 
coach! It’s right there in front — ” 

But as Ron continued to look bemused, a strange 
thought occurred to Harry. 

“Can’t ... can’t you see them?” 

“See what?” 

“Can’t you see what’s pulling the carriages?” 

Ron looked seriously alarmed now. 

“Are you feeling all right, Harry?” 

“I ... yeah ...” 

Harry felt utterly bewildered. The horse was there in 
front of him, gleaming solidly in the dim light issuing 

Page | 254Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




from the station windows behind them, vapor rising 
from its nostrils in the chilly night air. Yet unless Ron 
was faking — and it was a very feeble joke if he was — 
Ron could not see it at all. 

“Shall we get in, then?” said Ron uncertainly, looking 
at Harry as though worried about him. 

“Yeah,” said Harry. “Yeah, go on ...” 

“It’s all right,” said a dreamy voice from beside Harry 
as Ron vanished into the coach’s dark interior. 

“You’re not going mad or anything. I can see them 
too.” 

“Can you?” said Harry desperately, turning to Luna. 
He could see the bat-winged horses reflected in her 
wide, silvery eyes. 

“Oh yes,” said Luna, “I’ve been able to see them ever 
since my first day here. They’ve always pulled the 
carriages. Don’t worry. You’re just as sane as I am.” 

Smiling faintly, she climbed into the musty interior of 
the carriage after Ron. Not altogether reassured, 

Harry followed her.

XX 




THE SORTING HAT’S NEW SONG 

Harry did not want to tell the others that he and Luna 
were having the same hallucination, if that was what 
it was, so he said nothing about the horses as he sat 
down inside the carriage and slammed the door 
behind him. Nevertheless, he could not help watching 
the silhouettes of the horses moving beyond the 
window. 

“Did everyone see that Grubbly-Plank woman?” asked 
Ginny. “What’s she doing back here? Hagrid can’t 
have left, can he?” 

“I’ll be quite glad if he has,” said Luna. “He isn’t a 
very good teacher, is he?” 

“Yes, he is!” said Harry, Ron, and Ginny angrily. 

Harry glared at Hermione; she cleared her throat and 
quickly said, “Erm ... yes ... he’s very good.” 

“Well, we think he’s a bit of a joke in Ravenclaw,” said 
Luna, unfazed. 

Page | 256Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“You’ve got a rubbish sense of humor then,” Ron 
snapped, as the wheels below them creaked into 
motion. 

Luna did not seem perturbed by Ron’s rudeness; on 
the contrary, she simply watched him for a while as 
though he were a mildly interesting television 
program. 

Rattling and swaying, the carriages moved in convoy 
up the road. When they passed between the tall stone 
pillars topped with winged boars on either side of the 
gates to the school grounds, Harry leaned forward to 
try and see whether there were any lights on in 
Hagrid’s cabin by the Forbidden Forest, but the 
grounds were in complete darkness. Hogwarts Castle, 
however, loomed ever closer: a towering mass of 
turrets, jet-black against the dark sky, here and there 
a window blazing fiery bright above them. 

The carriages jingled to a halt near the stone steps 
leading up to the oak front doors and Harry got out of 
the carriage first. He turned again to look for lit 
windows down by the forest, but there was definitely 
no sign of life within Hagrid’s cabin. Unwillingly, 
because he had half hoped they would have vanished, 
he turned his eyes instead upon the strange, skeletal 
creatures standing quietly in the chill night air, their 
blank white eyes gleaming. 

Harry had once before had the experience of seeing 
something that Ron could not, but that had been a 
reflection in a mirror, something much more 
insubstantial than a hundred very solid-looking 
beasts strong enough to pull a fleet of carriages. If 
Luna was to be believed, the beasts had always been 
there but invisible; why, then, could Harry suddenly 
see them, and why could Ron not? 



Page | 257Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Are you coming or what?” said Ron beside him. 



“Oh ... yeah,” said Harry quickly, and they joined the 
crowd hurrying up the stone steps into the castle. 

The entrance hall was ablaze with torches and 
echoing with footsteps as the students crossed the 
flagged stone floor for the double doors to the right, 
leading to the Great Hall and the start-of-term feast. 

The four long House tables in the Great Hall were 
filling up under the starless black ceiling, which was 
just like the sky they could glimpse through the high 
windows. Candles floated in midair all along the 
tables, illuminating the silvery ghosts who were 
dotted about the Hall and the faces of the students 
talking eagerly to one another, exchanging summer 
news, shouting greetings at friends from other 
Houses, eyeing one another’s new haircuts and robes. 
Again Harry noticed people putting their heads 
together to whisper as he passed; he gritted his teeth 
and tried to act as though he neither noticed nor 
cared. 

Luna drifted away from them at the Ravenclaw table. 
The moment they reached Gryffindor’s, Ginny was 
hailed by some fellow fourth years and left to sit with 
them; Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville found seats 
together about halfway down the table between Nearly 
Headless Nick, the Gryffindor House ghost, and 
Parvati Patil and Lavender Brown, the last two of 
whom gave Harry airy, overly friendly greetings that 
made him quite sure they had stopped talking about 
him a split second before. He had more important 
things to worry about, however: He was looking over 
the students’ heads to the staff table that ran along 
the top wall of the Hall. 

“He’s not there.” 

Page | 258Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Ron and Hermione scanned the staff table too, though 
there was no real need; Hagrid’s size made him 
instantly obvious in any lineup. 

“He can’t have left,” said Ron, sounding slightly 
anxious. 

“Of course he hasn’t,” said Harry firmly. 

“You don’t think he’s ... hurt, or anything, do you?” 
said Hermione uneasily. 

“No,” said Harry at once. 

“But where is he, then?” 

There was a pause, then Harry said very quietly, so 
that Neville, Parvati, and Lavender could not hear, 
“Maybe he’s not back yet. You know — from his 
mission — the thing he was doing over the summer 
for Dumbledore.” 

“Yeah ... yeah, that’ll be it,” said Ron, sounding 
reassured, but Hermione bit her lip, looking up and 
down the staff table as though hoping for some 
conclusive explanation of Hagrid’s absence. 

“Who’s that?” she said sharply, pointing toward the 
middle of the staff table. 

Harry’s eyes followed hers. They lit first upon 
Professor Dumbledore, sitting in his high-backed 
golden chair at the center of the long staff table, 
wearing deep-purple robes scattered with silvery stars 
and a matching hat. Dumbledore’s head was inclined 
toward the woman sitting next to him, who was 
talking into his ear. She looked, Harry thought, like 
somebody’s maiden aunt: squat, with short, curly, 
mouse-brown hair in which she had placed a horrible 
Page | 259Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




pink Alice band that matched the fluffy pink cardigan 
she wore over her robes. Then she turned her face 
slightly to take a sip from her goblet and he saw, with 
a shock of recognition, a pallid, toadlike face and a 
pair of prominent, pouchy eyes. 

“It’s that Umbridge woman!” 

“Who?” said Hermione. 

“She was at my hearing, she works for Fudge!” 

“Nice cardigan,” said Ron, smirking. 

“She works for Fudge?” Hermione repeated, frowning. 
“What on earth’s she doing here, then?” 

“Dunno ...” 

Hermione scanned the staff table, her eyes narrowed. 

“No,” she muttered, “no, surely not ...” 

Harry did not understand what she was talking about 
but did not ask; his attention had just been caught by 
Professor Grubbly-Plank who had just appeared 
behind the staff table; she worked her way along to 
the very end and took the seat that ought to have 
been Hagrid’s. That meant that the first years must 
have crossed the lake and reached the castle, and 
sure enough, a few seconds later, the doors from the 
entrance hall opened. A long line of scared-looking 
first years entered, led by Professor McGonagall, who 
was carrying a stool on which sat an ancient wizard’s 
hat, heavily patched and darned with a wide rip near 
the frayed brim. 

The buzz of talk in the Great Hall faded away. The 
first years lined up in front of the staff table facing the 

Page | 260Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




rest of the students, and Professor McGonagall placed 
the stool carefully in front of them, then stood back. 

The first years’ faces glowed palely in the candlelight. 
A small boy right in the middle of the row looked as 
though he was trembling. Harry recalled, fleetingly, 
how terrified he had felt when he had stood there, 
waiting for the unknown test that would determine to 
which House he belonged. 

The whole school waited with bated breath. Then the 
rip near the hat’s brim opened wide like a mouth and 
the Sorting Hat burst into song: 

In times of old when I was new 
And Hogwarts barely started 
The founders of our noble school 
Thought never to be parted: 

United by a common goal, 

They had the selfsame yearning, 

To make the world’s best magic school 
And pass along their learning. 

“Together we will build and teach!” 

The four good friends decided 
And never did they dream that they 
Might someday be divided, 

For were there such friends anywhere 
As Slytherin and Gryffndor? 

Unless it was the second pair 
Of Huffepuff and Ravenclaw? 

So how could it have gone so wrong? 

How could such friendships fail? 

Why, I was there and so can tell 
The whole sad, sorry tale. 

Said Slytherin, “We’ll teach just those 
Whose ancestry is purest.” 

Said Ravenclaw, “We’ll teach those whose 
Intelligence is surest.” 

Said Gryffindor, “We’ll teach all those 

Page | 261Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




With brave deeds to their name,” 

Said Hufflepuff, “111 teach the lot, 

And treat them just the same.” 

These differences caused little strife 
When first they came to light, 

For each of the four founders had 
A House in which they might 
Take only those they wanted, so, 

For instance, Slytherin 
Took only pure-blood wizards 
Of great cunning, just like him, 

And only those of sharpest mind 
Were taught by Ravenclaw 
While the bravest and the boldest 
Went to daring Gryffindor. 

Good Hufflepuff she took the rest, 

And taught them all she knew, 

Thus the Houses and their founders 
Retained friendships firm and true. 

So Hogwarts worked in harmony 
For several happy years, 

But then discord crept among us 
Feeding on our faults and fears. 

The Houses that, like pillars four, 

Had once held up our school, 

Now turned upon each other and, 

Divided, sought to rule. 

And for a while it seemed the school 
Must meet an early end, 

What with dueling and with fighting 
And the clash of friend on friend 
And at last there came a morning 
When old Slytherin departed 
And though the fighting then died out 
He left us quite downhearted. 

And never since the founders four 
Were whittled down to three 
Have the Houses been united 
As they once were meant to be. 

Page | 262Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




And now the Sorting Hat is here 
And you all know the score: 

I sort you into Houses 
Because that is what I’m for, 

But this year I’ll go further, 

Listen closely to my song: 

Though condemned I am to split you 
Still I worry that it’s wrong, 

Though I must fulfill my duty 
And must quarter every year 
Still I wonder whether sorting 
May not bring the end I fear. 

Oh, know the perils, read the signs, 

The warning history shows, 

For our Hogwarts is in danger 
From external, deadly foes 
And we must unite inside her 
Or we’ll crumble from within. 

I have told you, I have warned you... 

Let the Sorting now begin. 

The hat became motionless once more; applause 
broke out, though it was punctured, for the first time 
in Harry’s memory, with muttering and whispers. All 
across the Great Hall students were exchanging 
remarks with their neighbors and Harry, clapping 
along with everyone else, knew exactly what they were 
talking about. 

“Branched out a bit this year, hasn’t it?” said Ron, his 
eyebrows raised. 

“Too right it has,” said Harry. 

The Sorting Hat usually confined itself to describing 
the different qualities looked for by each of the four 
Hogwarts Houses and its own role in sorting them; 
Harry could not remember it ever trying to give the 
school advice before. 

Page | 263Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“I wonder if it’s ever given warnings before?” said 
Hermione, sounding slightly anxious. 



“Yes, indeed,” said Nearly Headless Nick 
knowledgeably, leaning across Neville toward her 
(Neville winced, it was very uncomfortable to have a 
ghost lean through you). “The hat feels itself honor- 
bound to give the school due warning whenever it 
feels — ” 

But Professor McGonagall, who was waiting to read 
out the list of first years’ names, was giving the 
whispering students the sort of look that scorches. 
Nearly Headless Nick placed a see-through finger to 
his lips and sat primly upright again as the muttering 
came to an abrupt end. With a last frowning look that 
swept the four House tables, Professor McGonagall 
lowered her eyes to her long piece of parchment and 
called out, 

“Abercrombie, Euan.” 

The terrified-looking boy Harry had noticed earlier 
stumbled forward and put the hat on his head; it was 
only prevented from falling right down to his 
shoulders by his very prominent ears. The hat 
considered for a moment, then the rip near the brim 
opened again and shouted, “ GR YFFIND OR ! ” 

Harry clapped loudly with the rest of Gryffindor 
House as Euan Abercrombie staggered to their table 
and sat down, looking as though he would like very 
much to sink through the floor and never be looked at 
again. 

Slowly the long line of first years thinned; in the 
pauses between the names and the Sorting Hat’s 
decisions, Harry could hear Ron’s stomach rumbling 
loudly. Finally, “Zeller, Rose” was sorted into 

Page | 264Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Hufflepuff, and Professor McGonagall picked up the 
hat and stool and marched them away as Professor 
Dumbledore rose to his feet. 

Harry was somehow soothed to see Dumbledore 
standing before them all, whatever his recent bitter 
feelings toward his headmaster. Between the absence 
of Hagrid and the presence of those dragonish horses, 
he had felt that his return to Hogwarts, so long 
anticipated, was full of unexpected surprises like 
jarring notes in a familiar song. But this, at least, was 
how it was supposed to be: their headmaster rising to 
greet them all before the start-of-term feast. 

“To our newcomers,” said Dumbledore in a ringing 
voice, his arms stretched wide and a beaming smile 
on his lips, “welcome! To our old hands — welcome 
back! There is a time for speech making, but this is 
not it. Tuck in!” 

There was an appreciative laugh and an outbreak of 
applause as Dumbledore sat down neatly and threw 
his long beard over his shoulder so as to keep it out of 
the way of his plate — for food had appeared out of 
nowhere, so that the five long tables were groaning 
under joints and pies and dishes of vegetables, bread, 
sauces, and flagons of pumpkin juice. 

“Excellent,” said Ron, with a kind of groan of longing, 
and he seized the nearest plate of chops and began 
piling them onto his plate, watched wistfully by 
Nearly Headless Nick. 

“What were you saying before the Sorting?” Hermione 
asked the ghost. “About the hat giving warnings?” 

“Oh yes,” said Nick, who seemed glad of a reason to 
turn away from Ron, who was now eating roast 
potatoes with almost indecent enthusiasm. “Yes, I 

Page | 265Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




have heard the hat give several warnings before, 
always at times when it detects periods of great 
danger for the school. And always, of course, its 
advice is the same: Stand together, be strong from 
within.” 

“Ow kunnit nofe skusin danger ifzat?” said Ron. 

His mouth was so full Harry thought it was quite an 
achievement for him to make any noise at all. 

“I beg your pardon?” said Nearly Headless Nick 
politely, while Hermione looked revolted. Ron gave an 
enormous swallow and said, “How can it know if the 
school’s in danger if it’s a hat?” 

“I have no idea,” said Nearly Headless Nick. “Of 
course, it lives in Dumbledore’s office, so I daresay it 
picks things up there.” 

“And it wants all the Houses to be friends?” said 
Harry, looking over at the Slytherin table, where 
Draco Malfoy was holding court. “Fat chance.” 

“Well, now, you shouldn’t take that attitude,” said 
Nick reprovingly. “Peaceful cooperation, that’s the 
key. We ghosts, though we belong to separate Houses, 
maintain links of friendship. In spite of the 
competitiveness between Gryffindor and Slytherin, I 
would never dream of seeking an argument with the 
Bloody Baron.” 

“Only because you’re terrified of him,” said Ron. 

Nearly Headless Nick looked highly affronted. 

“Terrified? I hope I, Sir Nicholas de Mimsy- 
Porpington, have never been guilty of cowardice in my 
life! The noble blood that runs in my veins — ” 

Page | 266Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“What blood?” asked Ron. “Surely you haven’t still got 
— ?” 

“It’s a figure of speech!” said Nearly Headless Nick, 
now so annoyed his head was trembling ominously on 
his partially severed neck. “I assume I am still allowed 
to enjoy the use of whichever words I like, even if the 
pleasures of eating and drinking are denied me! But I 
am quite used to students poking fun at my death, I 
assure you!” 

“Nick, he wasn’t really laughing at you!” said 
Hermione, throwing a furious look at Ron. 

Unfortunately, Ron’s mouth was packed to exploding 
point again and all he could manage was “node 
iddum eentup sechew,” which Nick did not seem to 
think constituted an adequate apology. Rising into 
the air, he straightened his feathered hat and swept 
away from them to the other end of the table, coming 
to rest between the Creevey brothers, Colin and 
Dennis. 

“Well done, Ron,” snapped Hermione. 

“What?” said Ron indignantly, having managed, 
finally, to swallow his food. “I’m not allowed to ask a 
simple question?” 

“Oh forget it,” said Hermione irritably, and the pair of 
them spent the rest of the meal in huffy silence. 

Harry was too used to their bickering to bother trying 
to reconcile them; he felt it was a better use of his 
time to eat his way steadily through his steak-and- 
kidney pie, then a large plateful of his favorite treacle 
tart. 



Page | 267Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




When all the students had finished eating and the 
noise level in the hall was starting to creep upward 
again, Dumbledore got to his feet once more. Talking 
ceased immediately as all turned to face the 
headmaster. Harry was feeling pleasantly drowsy 
now. His four-poster bed was waiting somewhere 
above, wonderfully warm and soft... 

“Well, now that we are all digesting another 
magnificent feast, I beg a few moments of your 
attention for the usual start-of-term notices,” said 
Dumbledore. “First years ought to know that the 
forest in the grounds is out of bounds to students — 
and a few of our older students ought to know by now 
too.” (Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchanged smirks.) 

“Mr. Filch, the caretaker, has asked me, for what he 
tells me is the four hundred and sixty-second time, to 
remind you all that magic is not permitted in 
corridors between classes, nor are a number of other 
things, all of which can be checked on the extensive 
list now fastened to Mr. Filch’s office door. 

“We have had two changes in staffing this year. We 
are very pleased to welcome back Professor Grubbly- 
Plank, who will be taking Care of Magical Creatures 
lessons; we are also delighted to introduce Professor 
Umbridge, our new Defense Against the Dark Arts 
teacher.” 

There was a round of polite but fairly unenthusiastic 
applause during which Harry, Ron, and Hermione 
exchanged slightly panicked looks; Dumbledore had 
not said for how long Grubbly-Plank would be 
teaching. 

Dumbledore continued, “Tryouts for the House 
Quidditch teams will take place on the — ” 



Page | 268Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




He broke off, looking inquiringly at Professor 
Umbridge. As she was not much taller standing than 
sitting, there was a moment when nobody understood 
why Dumbledore had stopped talking, but then 
Professor Umbridge said, “Hem, hem,” and it became 
clear that she had got to her feet and was intending to 
make a speech. 

Dumbledore only looked taken aback for a moment, 
then he sat back down smartly and looked alertly at 
Professor Umbridge as though he desired nothing 
better than to listen to her talk. Other members of 
staff were not as adept at hiding their surprise. 
Professor Sprout’s eyebrows had disappeared into her 
flyaway hair, and Professor McGonagall’s mouth was 
as thin as Harry had ever seen it. No new teacher had 
ever interrupted Dumbledore before. Many of the 
students were smirking; this woman obviously did not 
know how things were done at Hogwarts. 

“Thank you, Headmaster,” Professor Umbridge 
simpered, “for those kind words of welcome.” 

Her voice was high-pitched, breathy, and little-girlish 
and again, Harry felt a powerful rush of dislike that 
he could not explain to himself; all he knew was that 
he loathed everything about her, from her stupid 
voice to her fluffy pink cardigan. She gave another 
little throat-clearing cough (“Hem, hem”) and 
continued: “Well, it is lovely to be back at Hogwarts, I 
must say!” She smiled, revealing very pointed teeth. 
“And to see such happy little faces looking back at 
me!” 

Harry glanced around. None of the faces he could see 
looked happy; on the contrary, they all looked rather 
taken aback at being addressed as though they were 
five years old. 



Page | 269Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“I am very much looking forward to getting to know 
you all, and I’m sure well be very good friends!” 

Students exchanged looks at this; some of them were 
barely concealing grins. 

“I’ll be her friend as long as I don’t have to borrow 
that cardigan,” Parvati whispered to Lavender, and 
both of them lapsed into silent giggles. 

Professor Umbridge cleared her throat again (“Hem, 
hem”), but when she continued, some of the 
breathiness had vanished from her voice. She 
sounded much more businesslike and now her words 
had a dull learned-by-heart sound to them. 

“The Ministry of Magic has always considered the 
education of young witches and wizards to be of vital 
importance. The rare gifts with which you were born 
may come to nothing if not nurtured and honed by 
careful instruction. The ancient skills unique to the 
Wizarding community must be passed down through 
the generations lest we lose them forever. The 
treasure trove of magical knowledge amassed by our 
ancestors must be guarded, replenished, and polished 
by those who have been called to the noble profession 
of teaching.” 

Professor Umbridge paused here and made a little 
bow to her fellow staff members, none of whom bowed 
back. Professor McGonagall’s dark eyebrows had 
contracted so that she looked positively hawklike, and 
Harry distinctly saw her exchange a significant glance 
with Professor Sprout as Umbridge gave another little 
“Hem, hem” and went on with her speech. 

“Every headmaster and headmistress of Hogwarts has 
brought something new to the weighty task of 
governing this historic school, and that is as it should 

Page | 270Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




be, for without progress there will be stagnation and 
decay. There again, progress for progress’s sake must 
be discouraged, for our tried and tested traditions 
often require no tinkering. A balance, then, between 
old and new, between permanence and change, 
between tradition and innovation ...” 

Harry found his attentiveness ebbing, as though his 
brain was slipping in and out of tune. The quiet that 
always filled the Hall when Dumbledore was speaking 
was breaking up as students put their heads 
together, whispering and giggling. Over at the 
Ravenclaw table, Cho Chang was chatting animatedly 
with her friends. A few seats along from Cho, Luna 
Lovegood had got out The Quibbler again. Meanwhile 
at the Hufflepuff table, Ernie Macmillan was one of 
the few still staring at Professor Umbridge, but he was 
glassy-eyed and Harry was sure he was only 
pretending to listen in an attempt to live up to the 
new prefect’s badge gleaming on his chest. 

Professor Umbridge did not seem to notice the 
restlessness of her audience. Harry had the 
impression that a full-scale riot could have broken 
out under her nose and she would have plowed on 
with her speech. The teachers, however, were still 
listening very attentively, and Hermione seemed to be 
drinking in every word Umbridge spoke, though 
judging by her expression, they were not at all to her 
taste. 

"... because some changes will be for the better, while 
others will come, in the fullness of time, to be 
recognized as errors of judgment. Meanwhile, some 
old habits will be retained, and rightly so, whereas 
others, outmoded and outworn, must be abandoned. 
Let us move forward, then, into a new era of 
openness, effectiveness, and accountability, intent on 
preserving what ought to be preserved, perfecting 
Page | 271Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




what needs to be perfected, and pruning wherever we 
find practices that ought to be prohibited.” 

She sat down. Dumbledore clapped. The staff followed 
his lead, though Harry noticed that several of them 
brought their hands together only once or twice 
before stopping. A few students joined in, but most 
had been taken unawares by the end of the speech, 
not having listened to more than a few words of it, 
and before they could start applauding properly, 
Dumbledore had stood up again. 

“Thank you very much, Professor Umbridge, that was 
most illuminating,” he said, bowing to her. “Now — as 
I was saying, Quidditch tryouts will be held ...” 

“Yes, it certainly was illuminating,” said Hermione in 
a low voice. 

“You’re not telling me you enjoyed it?” Ron said 
quietly, turning a glazed face upon Hermione. “That 
was about the dullest speech I’ve ever heard, and I 
grew up with Percy.” 

“I said illuminating, not enjoyable,” said Hermione. “It 
explained a lot.” 

“Did it?” said Harry in surprise. “Sounded like a load 
of waffle to me.” 

“There was some important stuff hidden in the 
waffle,” said Hermione grimly. 

“Was there?” said Ron blankly. 

“How about ‘progress for progress’s sake must be 
discouraged’? How about ‘pruning wherever we find 
practices that ought to be prohibited’?” 



Page | 272Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Well, what does that mean?” said Ron impatiently. 



“Ill tell you what it means,” said Hermione ominously. 
“It means the Ministry’s interfering at Hogwarts.” 

There was a great clattering and banging all around 
them; Dumbledore had obviously just dismissed the 
school, because everyone was standing up ready to 
leave the Hall. Hermione jumped up, looking 
flustered. 

“Ron, we’re supposed to show the first years where to 
go!” 

“Oh yeah,” said Ron, who had obviously forgotten. 
“Hey — hey you lot! Midgets!” 

“Ron\” 

“Well, they are, they’re titchy...” 

“I know, but you can’t call them midgets... First 
years!” Hermione called commandingly along the 
table. “This way, please!” 

A group of new students walked shyly up the gap 
between the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff tables, all of 
them trying hard not to lead the group. They did 
indeed seem very small; Harry was sure he had not 
appeared that young when he had arrived here. He 
grinned at them. A blond boy next to Euan 
Abercrombie looked petrified, nudged Euan, and 
whispered something in his ear. Euan Abercrombie 
looked equally frightened and stole a horrified look at 
Harry, who felt the grin slide off his face like 
Stinksap. 

“See you later,” he said to Ron and Hermione and he 
made his way out of the Great Hall alone, doing 

Page | 273Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




everything he could to ignore more whispering, 
staring, and pointing as he passed. He kept his eyes 
fixed ahead as he wove his way through the crowd in 
the entrance hall, then he hurried up the marble 
staircase, took a couple of concealed shortcuts, and 
had soon left most of the crowds behind. 

He had been stupid not to expect this, he thought 
angrily, as he walked through much emptier upstairs 
corridors. Of course everyone was staring at him: He 
had emerged from the Triwizard maze two months ago 
clutching the dead body of a fellow student and 
claiming to have seen Lord Voldemort return to 
power. There had not been time last term to explain 
himself before everyone went home, even if he had felt 
up to giving the whole school a detailed account of the 
terrible events in that graveyard. 

He had reached the end of the corridor to the 
Gryffindor common room and had come to a halt in 
front of the portrait of the Fat Lady before he realized 
that he did not know the new password. 

“Er ...” he said glumly, staring up at the Fat Lady, 
who smoothed the folds of her pink satin dress and 
looked sternly back at him. 

“No password, no entrance,” she said loftily. 

“Harry, I know it!” someone panted from behind him, 
and he turned to see Neville jogging toward him. 
“Guess what it is? I’m actually going to be able to 
remember it for once — ” He waved the stunted little 
cactus he had shown them on the train. “Mimbulus 
mimbletonio 1” 

“Correct,” said the Fat Lady, and her portrait swung 
open toward them like a door, revealing a circular 



Page | 274Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




hole in the wall behind, through which Harry and 
Neville now climbed. 

The Gryffindor common room looked as welcoming as 
ever, a cozy circular tower room full of dilapidated 
squashy armchairs and rickety old tables. A fire was 
crackling merrily in the grate and a few people were 
warming their hands before going up to their 
dormitories; on the other side of the room Fred and 
George Weasley were pinning something up on the 
notice board. Harry waved good night to them and 
headed straight for the door to the boys’ dormitories; 
he was not in much of a mood for talking at the 
moment. Neville followed him. 

Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnigan had reached the 
dormitory first and were in the process of covering the 
walls beside their beds with posters and photographs. 
They had been talking as Harry pushed open the door 
but stopped abruptly the moment they saw him. 

Harry wondered whether they had been talking about 
him, then whether he was being paranoid. 

“Hi,” he said, moving across to his own trunk and 
opening it. 

“Hey, Harry,” said Dean, who was putting on a pair of 
pajamas in the West Ham colors. “Good holiday?” 

“Not bad,” muttered Harry, as a true account of his 
holiday would have taken most of the night to relate 
and he could not face it. “You?” 

“Yeah, it was okay,” chuckled Dean. “Better than 
Seamus’s anyway, he was just telling me.” 

“Why, what happened, Seamus?” Neville asked as he 
placed his Mimbulus mimbletonia tenderly on his 
bedside cabinet. 

Page | 275Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Seamus did not answer immediately; he was making 
rather a meal of ensuring that his poster of the 
Kenmare Kestrels Quidditch team was quite straight. 
Then he said, with his back still turned to Harry, “Me 
mam didn’t want me to come back.” 

“What?” said Harry, pausing in the act of pulling off 
his robes. 

“She didn’t want me to come back to Hogwarts.” 

Seamus turned away from his poster and pulled his 
own pajamas out of his trunk, still not looking at 
Harry. 

“But — why?” said Harry, astonished. He knew that 
Seamus’s mother was a witch and could not 
understand, therefore, why she should have come 
over so Dursley-ish. 

Seamus did not answer until he had finished 
buttoning his pajamas. 

“Well,” he said in a measured voice, “I suppose ... 
because of you.” 

“What d’you mean?” said Harry quickly. His heart was 
beating rather fast. He felt vaguely as though 
something was closing in on him. 

“Well,” said Seamus again, still avoiding Harry’s eyes, 
“she ... er ... well, it’s not just you, it’s Dumbledore 
too ...” 

“She believes the Daily Prophet?” said Harry. “She 
thinks I’m a liar and Dumbledore ’s an old fool?” 

Seamus looked up at him. “Yeah, something like 
that.” 

Page | 276Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Harry said nothing. He threw his wand down onto his 
bedside table, pulled off his robes, stuffed them 
angrily into his trunk, and pulled on his pajamas. He 
was sick of it; sick of being the person who was stared 
at and talked about all the time. If any of them knew, 
if any of them had the faintest idea what it felt like to 
be the one all these things had happened to ... Mrs. 
Finnigan had no idea, the stupid woman, he thought 
savagely. 

He got into bed and made to pull the hangings closed 
around him, but before he could do so, Seamus said, 
“Look . . . what did happen that night when . . . you 
know, when . . . with Cedric Diggory and all?” 

Seamus sounded nervous and eager at the same time. 
Dean, who had been bending over his trunk, trying to 
retrieve a slipper, went oddly still and Harry knew he 
was listening hard. 

“What are you asking me for?” Harry retorted. “Just 
read the Daily Prophet like your mother, why don’t 
you? That’ll tell you all you need to know.” 

“Don’t you have a go at my mother,” snapped 
Seamus. 

“I’ll have a go at anyone who calls me a liar,” said 
Harry. 

“Don’t talk to me like that!” 

“I’ll talk to you how I want,” said Harry, his temper 
rising so fast he snatched his wand back from his 
bedside table. “If you’ve got a problem sharing a 
dormitory with me, go and ask McGonagall if you can 
be moved, stop your mummy worrying — ” 

“Leave my mother out of this, Potter!” 

Page | 277Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“What’s going on?” 

Ron had appeared in the doorway. His wide eyes 
traveled from Harry, who was kneeling on his bed 
with his wand pointing at Seamus, to Seamus, who 
was standing there with his fists raised. 

“He’s having a go at my mother!” Seamus yelled. 

“What?” said Ron. “Harry wouldn’t do that — we met 
your mother, we liked her...” 

“That’s before she started believing every word the 
stinking Daily Prophet writes about me!” said Harry at 
the top of his voice. 

“Oh,” said Ron, comprehension dawning across his 
freckled face. “Oh ... right.” 

“You know what?” said Seamus heatedly, casting 
Harry a venomous look. “He’s right, I don’t want to 
share a dormitory with him anymore, he’s a 
madman.” 

“That’s out of order, Seamus,” said Ron, whose ears 
were starting to glow red, always a danger sign. 

“Out of order, am I?” shouted Seamus, who in 
contrast with Ron was turning paler. “You believe all 
the rubbish he’s come out with about You-Know-Who, 
do you, you reckon he’s telling the truth?” 

“Yeah, I do!” said Ron angrily. 

“Then you’re mad too,” said Seamus in disgust. 

“Yeah? Well unfortunately for you, pal, I’m also a 
prefect!” said Ron, jabbing himself in the chest with a 



Page | 278Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




finger. “So unless you want detention, watch your 
mouth!” 

Seamus looked for a few seconds as though detention 
would be a reasonable price to pay to say what was 
going through his mind; but with a noise of contempt 
he turned on his heel, vaulted into bed, and pulled 
the hangings shut with such violence that they were 
ripped from the bed and fell in a dusty pile to the 
floor. Ron glared at Seamus, then looked at Dean and 
Neville. 

“Anyone else’s parents got a problem with Harry?” he 
said aggressively. 

“My parents are Muggles, mate,” said Dean, 
shrugging. “They don’t know nothing about no deaths 
at Hogwarts, because I’m not stupid enough to tell 
them.” 

“You don’t know my mother, she’ll weasel anything 
out of anyone!” Seamus snapped at him. “Anyway, 
your parents don’t get the Daily Prophet, they don’t 
know our headmaster’s been sacked from the 
Wizengamot and the International Confederation of 
Wizards because he’s losing his marbles — ” 

“My gran says that’s rubbish,” piped up Neville. “She 
says it’s the Daily Prophet that’s going downhill, not 
Dumbledore. She’s canceled our subscription. We 
believe Harry,” he said simply. He climbed into bed 
and pulled the covers up to his chin, looking owlishly 
over them at Seamus. “My gran’s always said You- 
Know-Who would come back one day. She says if 
Dumbledore says he’s back, he’s back.” 

Harry felt a rush of gratitude toward Neville. Nobody 
else said anything. Seamus got out his wand, repaired 
the bed hangings, and vanished behind them. Dean 

Page | 279Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




got into bed, rolled over, and fell silent. Neville, who 
appeared to have nothing more to say either, was 
gazing fondly at his moonlit cactus. 

Harry lay back on his pillows while Ron bustled 
around the next bed, putting his things away. He felt 
shaken by the argument with Seamus, whom he had 
always liked very much. How many more people were 
going to suggest that he was lying or unhinged? 

Had Dumbledore suffered like this all summer, as 
first the Wizengamot, then the International 
Confederation of Wizards had thrown him from their 
ranks? Was it anger at Harry, perhaps, that had 
stopped Dumbledore getting in touch with him for 
months? The two of them were in this together, after 
all; Dumbledore had believed Harry, announced his 
version of events to the whole school and then to the 
wider Wizarding community. Anyone who thought 
Harry was a liar had to think that Dumbledore was 
too or else that Dumbledore had been hoodwinked... 

They’ll know we’re right in the end, thought Harry 
miserably, as Ron got into bed and extinguished the 
last candle in the dormitory. But he wondered how 
many attacks like Seamus’s he would have to endure 
before that time came. 



Page | 280Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 






PROFESSOR UMBRIDGE 

Seamus dressed at top speed next morning and left 
the dormitory before Harry had even put on his socks. 

“Does he think hell turn into a nutter if he stays in a 
room with me too long?” asked Harry loudly, as the 
hem of Seamus’s robes whipped out of sight. 

“Don’t worry about it, Harry,” Dean muttered, 
hoisting his school-bag onto his shoulder. “He’s just 
...” But apparently he was unable to say exactly what 
Seamus was, and after a slightly awkward pause 
followed him out of the room. 

Neville and Ron both gave Harry it’s-his-problem-not- 
yours looks, but Harry was not much consoled. How 
much more of this was he going to have to take? 

“What’s the matter?” asked Hermione five minutes 
later, catching up with Harry and Ron halfway across 
the common room as they all headed toward 



Page | 281Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 



breakfast. “You look absolutely — oh for heaven’s 
sake.” 



She was staring at the common room notice board, 
where a large new sign had been put up. 

GALLONS OF GALLEONS! 

Pocket money failing to keep pace with your 
outgoings?

“They are the limit,” said Hermione grimly, taking 
down the sign, which Fred and George had pinned up 
over a poster giving the date of the first Hogsmeade 
weekend in October. “We’ll have to talk to them, Ron.” 

Ron looked positively alarmed. 

“Why?” 

“Because we’re prefects!” said Hermione, as they 
climbed out through the portrait hole. “It’s up to us to 
stop this kind of thing!” 

Ron said nothing; Harry could tell from his glum 
expression that the prospect of stopping Fred and 

Page | 282Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




George doing exactly what they liked was not one that 
he found inviting. 

“Anyway, what’s up, Harry?” Hermione continued, as 
they walked down a flight of stairs lined with portraits 
of old witches and wizards, all of whom ignored them, 
being engrossed in their own conversation. “You look 
really angry about something.” 

“Seamus reckons Harry’s lying about You-Know- 
Who,” said Ron succinctly, when Harry did not 
respond. 

Hermione, whom Harry had expected to react angrily 
on his behalf, sighed. 

“Yes, Lavender thinks so too,” she said gloomily. 

“Been having a nice little chat with her about whether 
or not I’m a lying, attention-seeking prat, have you?” 
Harry said loudly. 

“No,” said Hermione calmly, “I told her to keep her big 
fat mouth shut about you, actually. And it would be 
quite nice if you stopped jumping down Ron’s and my 
throats, Harry, because if you haven’t noticed, we’re 
on your side.” 

There was a short pause. 

“Sorry,” said Harry in a low voice. 

“That’s quite all right,” said Hermione with dignity. 
Then she shook her head. “Don’t you remember what 
Dumbledore said at the end-of-term feast last year?” 

Harry and Ron both looked at her blankly, and 
Hermione sighed again. 



Page | 283Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“About You-Know-Who. He said, ‘His gift for spreading 
discord and enmity is very great. We can fight it only 
by showing an equally strong bond of friendship and 
trust — ’ ” 

“How do you remember stuff like that?” asked Ron, 
looking at her in admiration. 

“I listen, Ron,” said Hermione with a touch of 
asperity. 

“So do I, but I still couldn’t tell you exactly what — ” 

“The point,” Hermione pressed on loudly, “is that this 
sort of thing is exactly what Dumbledore was talking 
about. You-Know- Who’s only been back two months, 
and we’ve started fighting among ourselves. And the 
Sorting Hat’s warning was the same — stand 
together, be united — ” 

“And Harry said it last night,” retorted Ron, “if that 
means we’re supposed to get matey with the 
Slytherins, fat chance.” 

“Well, I think it’s a pity we’re not trying for a bit of 
inter-House unity,” said Hermione crossly. 

They had reached the foot of the marble staircase. A 
line of fourth-year Ravenclaws was crossing the 
entrance hall; they caught sight of Harry and hurried 
to form a tighter group, as though frightened he 
might attack stragglers. 

“Yeah, we really ought to be trying to make friends 
with people like that,” said Harry sarcastically. 

They followed the Ravenclaws into the Great Hall, 
looking instinctively at the staff table as they entered. 
Professor Grubbly-Plank was chatting to Professor 

Page | 284Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Sinistra, the Astronomy teacher, and Hagrid was once 
again conspicuous only by his absence. The 
enchanted ceiling above them echoed Harry’s mood; it 
was a miserable rain-cloud gray. 

“Dumbledore didn’t even mention how long that 
Grubbly-Plank woman’s staying,” he said, as they 
made their way across to the Gryffindor table. 

“Maybe ...” said Hermione thoughtfully. 

“What?” said both Harry and Ron together. 

“Well ... maybe he didn’t want to draw attention to 
Hagrid not being here.” 

“What d’you mean, draw attention to it?” said Ron, 
half laughing. “How could we not notice?” 

Before Hermione could answer, a tall black girl with 
long, braided hair had marched up to Harry. 

“Hi, Angelina.” 

“Hi,” she said briskly, “good summer?” And without 
waiting for an answer, “Listen, I’ve been made 
Gryffindor Quidditch Captain.” 

“Nice one,” said Harry, grinning at her; he suspected 
Angelina’s pep talks might not be as long-winded as 
Oliver Wood’s had been, which could only be an 
improvement. 

“Yeah, well, we need a new Keeper now Oliver’s left. 
Tryouts are on Friday at five o’clock and I want the 
whole team there, all right? Then we can see how the 
new person’ll fit in.” 



Page | 285Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Okay,” said Harry, and she smiled at him and 
departed. 

“I’d forgotten Wood had left,” said Hermione vaguely, 
sitting down beside Ron and pulling a plate of toast 
toward her. “I suppose that will make quite a 
difference to the team?” 

“I s’pose,” said Harry, taking the bench opposite. “He 
was a good Keeper...” 

“Still, it won’t hurt to have some new blood, will it?” 
said Ron. 

With a whoosh and a clatter, hundreds of owls came 
soaring in through the upper windows. They 
descended all over the Hall, bringing letters and 
packages to their owners and showering the 
breakfasters with droplets of water; it was clearly 
raining hard outside. Hedwig was nowhere to be seen, 
but Harry was hardly surprised; his only 
correspondent was Sirius, and he doubted Sirius 
would have anything new to tell him after only 
twenty-four hours apart. Hermione, however, had to 
move her orange juice aside quickly to make way for a 
large damp barn owl bearing a sodden Daily Prophet 
in its beak. 

“What are you still getting that for?” said Harry 
irritably, thinking of Seamus, as Hermione placed a 
Knut in the leather pouch on the owl’s leg and it took 
off again. “I’m not bothering ... load of rubbish.” 

“It’s best to know what the enemy are saying,” said 
Hermione darkly, and she unfurled the newspaper 
and disappeared behind it, not emerging until Harry 
and Ron had finished eating. 



Page | 286Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Nothing,” she said simply, rolling up the newspaper 
and laying it down by her plate. “Nothing about you 
or Dumbledore or anything.” 

Professor McGonagall was now moving along the table 
handing out schedules. 

“Look at today!” groaned Ron. “History of Magic, 
double Potions, Divination, and double Defense 
Against the Dark Arts ... Binns, Snape, Trelawney, 
and that Umbridge woman all in one day! I wish Fred 
and George ’d hurry up and get those Skiving 
Snackboxes sorted...” 

“Do mine ears deceive me?” said Fred, arriving with 
George and squeezing onto the bench beside Harry. 
“Hogwarts prefects surely don’t wish to skive off 
lessons?” 

“Look what we’ve got today,” said Ron grumpily, 
shoving his schedule under Fred’s nose. “That’s the 
worst Monday I’ve ever seen.” 

“Fair point, little bro,” said Fred, scanning the 
column. “You can have a bit of Nosebleed Nougat 
cheap if you like.” 

“Why’s it cheap?” said Ron suspiciously. 

“Because you’ll keep bleeding till you shrivel up, we 
haven’t got an antidote yet,” said George, helping 
himself to a kipper. 

“Cheers,” said Ron moodily, pocketing his schedule, 
“but I think I’ll take the lessons.” 

“And speaking of your Skiving Snackboxes,” said 
Hermione, eyeing Fred and George beadily, “you can’t 
advertise for testers on the Gryffindor notice board.” 

Page | 287Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Says who?” said George, looking astonished. 

“Says me,” said Hermione. “And Ron.” 

“Leave me out of it,” said Ron hastily. 

Hermione glared at him. Fred and George sniggered. 

“You’ll be singing a different tune soon enough, 
Hermione,” said Fred, thickly buttering a crumpet. 
“You’re starting your fifth year, you’ll be begging us 
for a Snackbox before long.” 

“And why would starting fifth year mean I want a 
Skiving Snackbox?” asked Hermione. 

“Fifth year’s O.W.L. year,” said George. 

“So?” 

“So you’ve got your exams coming up, haven’t you? 
They’ll be keeping your noses so hard to that 
grindstone they’ll be rubbed raw,” said Fred with 
satisfaction. 

“Half our year had minor breakdowns coming up to 
O.W.L.s,” said George happily. “Tears and tantrums 
... Patricia Stimpson kept coming over faint...” 

“Kenneth Towler came out in boils, d’you remember?” 
said Fred reminiscently. 

“That’s ’cause you put Bulbadox Powder in his 
pajamas,” said George. 

“Oh yeah,” said Fred, grinning. “I’d forgotten... Hard 
to keep track sometimes, isn’t it?” 



Page | 288Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Anyway, it’s a nightmare of a year, the fifth,” said 
George. “If you care about exam results anyway. Fred 
and I managed to keep our spirits up somehow.” 

“Yeah ... you got, what was it, three O.W.L.s each?” 
said Ron. 

“Yep,” said Fred unconcernedly. “But we feel our 
futures lie outside the world of academic 
achievement.” 

“We seriously debated whether we were going to 
bother coming back for our seventh year,” said 
George brightly, “now that we’ve got — ” 

He broke off at a warning look from Harry, who knew 
George had been about to mention the Triwizard 
winnings he had given them. 

“ — now that we’ve got our O.W.L.s,” George said 
hastily. “I mean, do we really need N.E.W.T.s? But we 
didn’t think Mum could take us leaving school early, 
not on top of Percy turning out to be the world’s 
biggest prat.” 

“We’re not going to waste our last year here, though,” 
said Fred, looking affectionately around at the Great 
Hall. “We’re going to use it to do a bit of market 
research, find out exactly what the average Hogwarts 
student requires from his joke shop, carefully 
evaluate the results of our research, and then 
produce the products to fit the demand.” 

“But where are you going to get the gold to start a 
joke shop?” asked Hermione skeptically. “You’re going 
to need all the ingredients and materials — and 
premises too, I suppose...” 



Page | 289Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Harry did not look at the twins. His face felt hot; he 
deliberately dropped his fork and dived down to 
retrieve it. He heard Fred say overhead, “Ask us no 
questions and well tell you no lies, Hermione. C’mon, 
George, if we get there early we might be able to sell a 
few Extendable Ears before Herbology.” 

Harry emerged from under the table to see Fred and 
George walking away, each carrying a stack of toast. 

“What did that mean?” said Hermione, looking from 
Harry to Ron. “ ‘Ask us no questions ...’ Does that 
mean they’ve already got some gold to start a joke 
shop?” 

“You know, I’ve been wondering about that,” said 
Ron, his brow furrowed. “They bought me a new set of 
dress robes this summer, and I couldn’t understand 
where they got the Galleons...” 

Harry decided it was time to steer the conversation 
out of these dangerous waters. 

“D’you reckon it’s true this year’s going to be really 
tough? Because of the exams?” 

“Oh yeah,” said Ron. “Bound to be, isn’t it? O.W.L.s 
are really important, affect the jobs you can apply for 
and everything. We get career advice too, later this 
year, Bill told me. So you can choose what N.E.W.T.s 
you want to do next year.” 

“D’you know what you want to do after Hogwarts?” 
Harry asked the other two, as they left the Great Hall 
shortly afterward and set off toward their History of 
Magic classroom. 

“Not really,” said Ron slowly. “Except ... well ...” 



Page | 290Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




He looked slightly sheepish. 



“What?” Harry urged him. 

“Well, it’d be cool to be an Auror,” said Ron in an 
offhand voice. 

“Yeah, it would,” said Harry fervently. 

“But they’re, like, the elite,” said Ron. “You’ve got to 
be really good. What about you, Hermione?” 

“I don’t know,” said Hermione. “I think I’d really like 
to do something worthwhile.” 

“An Auror’s worthwhile!” said Harry. 

“Yes, it is, but it’s not the only worthwhile thing,” said 
Hermione thoughtfully. “I mean, if I could take 
S.P.E.W. further ...” 

Harry and Ron carefully avoided looking at each 
other. 

History of Magic was by common consent the most 
boring subject ever devised by Wizard-kind. Professor 
Binns, their ghost teacher, had a wheezy, droning 
voice that was almost guaranteed to cause severe 
drowsiness within ten minutes, five in warm weather. 
He never varied the form of their lessons, but lectured 
them without pausing while they took notes, or 
rather, gazed sleepily into space. Harry and Ron had 
so far managed to scrape passes in this subject only 
by copying Hermione’s notes before exams; she alone 
seemed able to resist the soporific power of Binns ’s 
voice. 

Today they suffered through three quarters of an 
hour’s droning on the subject of giant wars. Harry 

Page | 291Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




heard just enough within the first ten minutes to 
appreciate dimly that in another teacher’s hands this 
subject might have been mildly interesting, but then 
his brain disengaged, and he spent the remaining 
thirty-five minutes playing hangman on a corner of 
his parchment with Ron, while Hermione shot them 
filthy looks out of the corner of her eye. 

“How would it be,” she asked them coldly as they left 
the classroom for break (Binns drifting away through 
the blackboard), “if I refused to lend you my notes 
this year?” 

“We’d fail our O.W.L.s,” said Ron. “If you want that on 
your conscience, Hermione ...” 

“Well, you’d deserve it,” she snapped. “You don’t even 
try to listen to him, do you?” 

“We do try,” said Ron. “We just haven’t got your 
brains or your memory or your concentration — 
you’re just cleverer than we are — is it nice to rub it 
in?” 



“Oh, don’t give me that rubbish,” said Hermione, but 
she looked slightly mollified as she led the way out 
into the damp courtyard. 

A fine misty drizzle was falling, so that the people 
standing in huddles around the yard looked blurred 
at the edges. Harry, Ron, and Hermione chose a 
secluded corner under a heavily dripping balcony, 
turning up the collars of their robes against the chilly 
September air and talking about what Snape was 
likely to set them in the first lesson of the year. They 
had got as far as agreeing that it was likely to be 
something extremely difficult, just to catch them off 
guard after a two-month holiday, when someone 
walked around the corner toward them. 

Page | 292Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Hello, Harry!” 



It was Cho Chang and what was more, she was on 
her own again. This was most unusual: Cho was 
almost always surrounded by a gang of giggling girls; 
Harry remembered the agony of trying to get her by 
herself to ask her to the Yule Ball. 

“Hi,” said Harry, feeling his face grow hot. At least 
you’re not covered in Stinksap this time, he told 
himself. Cho seemed to be thinking along the same 
lines. 

“You got that stuff off, then?” 

“Yeah,” said Harry, trying to grin as though the 
memory of their last meeting was funny as opposed to 
mortifying. “So did you ... er ... have a good summer?” 

The moment he had said this he wished he hadn’t: 
Cedric had been Cho’s boyfriend and the memory of 
his death must have affected her holiday almost as 
badly as it had affected Harry’s... Something seemed 
to tauten in her face, but she said, “Oh, it was all 
right, you know...” 

“Is that a Tornados badge?” Ron demanded suddenly, 
pointing at the front of Cho’s robes, to which a sky- 
blue badge emblazoned with a double gold T was 
pinned. “You don’t support them, do you?” 

“Yeah, I do,” said Cho. 

“Have you always supported them, or just since they 
started winning the league?” said Ron, in what Harry 
considered an unnecessarily accusatory tone of voice. 

“I’ve supported them since I was six,” said Cho coolly. 
“Anyway ... see you, Harry.” 

Page | 293Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




She walked away. Hermione waited until Cho was 
halfway across the courtyard before rounding on Ron. 



“You are so tactless!” 

“What? I only asked her if — ” 

“Couldn’t you tell she wanted to talk to Harry on her 
own?” 

“So? She could’ve done, I wasn’t stopping — ” 

“What on earth were you attacking her about her 
Quidditch team for?” 

“Attacking? I wasn’t attacking her, I was only — ” 

“Who cares if she supports the Tornados?” 

“Oh, come on, half the people you see wearing those 
badges only bought them last season — ” 

“But what does it matter?” 

“It means they’re not real fans, they’re just jumping 
on the bandwagon — ” 

“That’s the bell,” said Harry listlessly, because Ron 
and Hermione were bickering too loudly to hear it. 
They did not stop arguing all the way down to Snape’s 
dungeon, which gave Harry plenty of time to reflect 
that between Neville and Ron he would be lucky ever 
to have two minutes’ conversation with Cho that he 
could look back on without wanting to leave the 
country. 

And yet, he thought, as they joined the queue lining 
up outside Snape’s classroom door, she had chosen 
to come and talk to him, hadn’t she? She had been

Cedric’s girlfriend; she could easily have hated Harry 
for coming out of the Triwizard maze alive when 
Cedric had died, yet she was talking to him in a 
perfectly friendly way, not as though she thought him 
mad, or a liar, or in some horrible way responsible for 
Cedric’s death... Yes, she had definitely chosen to 
come and talk to him, and that made the second time 
in two days . . . and at this thought, Harry’s spirits 
rose. Even the ominous sound of Snape’s dungeon 
door creaking open did not puncture the small, 
hopeful bubble that seemed to have swelled in his 
chest. He filed into the classroom behind Ron and 
Hermione and followed them to their usual table at 
the back, ignoring the huffy, irritable noises now 
issuing from both of them. 

“Settle down,” said Snape coldly, shutting the door 
behind him. 

There was no real need for the call to order; the 
moment the class had heard the door close, quiet had 
fallen and all fidgeting stopped. Snape’s mere 
presence was usually enough to ensure a class’s 
silence. 

“Before we begin today’s lesson,” said Snape, 
sweeping over to his desk and staring around at them 
all, “I think it appropriate to remind you that next 
June you will be sitting an important examination, 
during which you will prove how much you have 
learned about the composition and use of magical 
potions. Moronic though some of this class 
undoubtedly are, I expect you to scrape an 
‘Acceptable’ in your O.W.L., or suffer my ... 
displeasure.” 

His gaze lingered this time upon Neville, who gulped. 



Page | 295Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“After this year, of course, many of you will cease 
studying with me,” Snape went on. “I take only the 
very best into my N.E.W.T. Potions class, which 
means that some of us will certainly be saying good- 
bye.” 

His eyes rested on Harry and his lip curled. Harry 
glared back, feeling a grim pleasure at the idea that 
he would be able to give up Potions after fifth year. 

“But we have another year to go before that happy 
moment of farewell,” said Snape softly, “so whether 
you are intending to attempt N.E.W.T. or not, I advise 
all of you to concentrate your efforts upon 
maintaining the high-pass level I have come to expect 
from my O.W.L. students. 

“Today we will be mixing a potion that often comes up 
at Ordinary Wizarding Level: the Draught of Peace, a 
potion to calm anxiety and soothe agitation. Be 
warned: If you are too heavy-handed with the 
ingredients you will put the drinker into a heavy and 
sometimes irreversible sleep, so you will need to pay 
close attention to what you are doing.” On Harry’s 
left, Hermione sat up a little straighter, her 
expression one of the utmost attentiveness. “The 
ingredients and method” — Snape flicked his wand — 
“are on the blackboard” — (they appeared there) — 
“you will find everything you need” — he flicked his 
wand again — “in the store cupboard” — (the door of 
the said cupboard sprang open) — “you have an hour 
and a half... Start.” 

Just as Harry, Ron, and Hermione had predicted, 
Snape could hardly have set them a more difficult, 
fiddly potion. The ingredients had to be added to the 
cauldron in precisely the right order and quantities; 
the mixture had to be stirred exactly the right number 
of times, firstly in clockwise, then in counterclockwise 
Page | 296Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




directions; the heat of the flames on which it was 
simmering had to be lowered to exactly the right level 
for a specific number of minutes before the final 
ingredient was added. 

“A light silver vapor should now be rising from your 
potion,” called Snape, with ten minutes left to go. 

Harry, who was sweating profusely, looked 
desperately around the dungeon. His own cauldron 
was issuing copious amounts of dark gray steam; 
Ron’s was spitting green sparks. Seamus was 
feverishly prodding the flames at the base of his 
cauldron with the tip of his wand, as they had gone 
out. The surface of Hermione’s potion, however, was a 
shimmering mist of silver vapor, and as Snape swept 
by he looked down his hooked nose at it without 
comment, which meant that he could find nothing to 
criticize. At Harry’s cauldron, however, Snape 
stopped, looking down at Harry with a horrible smirk 
on his face. 

“Potter, what is this supposed to be?” 

The Slytherins at the front of the class all looked up 
eagerly; they loved hearing Snape taunt Harry. 

“The Draught of Peace,” said Harry tensely. 

“Tell me, Potter,” said Snape softly, “can you read?” 

Draco Malfoy laughed. 

“Yes, I can,” said Harry, his fingers clenched tightly 
around his wand. 

“Read the third line of the instructions for me, Potter.” 



Page | 297Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Harry squinted at the blackboard; it was not easy to 
make out the instructions through the haze of 
multicolored steam now filling the dungeon. 

“ ‘Add powdered moonstone, stir three times 
counterclockwise, allow to simmer for seven minutes, 
then add two drops of syrup of hellebore.’ ” 

His heart sank. He had not added syrup of hellebore, 
but had proceeded straight to the fourth line of the 
instructions after allowing his potion to simmer for 
seven minutes. 

“Did you do everything on the third line, Potter?” 

“No,” said Harry very quietly. 

“I beg your pardon?” 

“No,” said Harry, more loudly. “I forgot the 
hellebore...” 

“I know you did, Potter, which means that this mess 
is utterly worthless. Evanesco.” 

The contents of Harry’s potion vanished; he was left 
standing foolishly beside an empty cauldron. 

“Those of you who have managed to read the 
instructions, fill one flagon with a sample of your 
potion, label it clearly with your name, and bring it up 
to my desk for testing,” said Snape. “Homework: 
twelve inches of parchment on the properties of 
moonstone and its uses in potion-making, to be 
handed in on Thursday.” 

While everyone around him filled their flagons, Harry 
cleared away his things, seething. His potion had 
been no worse than Ron’s, which was now giving off a 

Page | 298Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




foul odor of bad eggs, or Neville’s, which had achieved 
the consistency of just-mixed cement and which 
Neville was now having to gouge out of his cauldron, 
yet it was he, Harry, who would be receiving zero 
marks for the day’s work. He stuffed his wand back 
into his bag and slumped down onto his seat, 
watching everyone else march up to Snape’s desk 
with filled and corked flagons. When at long last the 
bell rang, Harry was first out of the dungeon and had 
already started his lunch by the time Ron and 
Hermione joined him in the Great Hall. The ceiling 
had turned an even murkier gray during the morning. 
Rain was lashing the high windows. 

“That was really unfair,” said Hermione consolingly, 
sitting down next to Harry and helping herself to 
shepherd’s pie. “Your potion wasn’t nearly as bad as 
Goyle’s, when he put it in his flagon the whole thing 
shattered and set his robes on fire.” 

“Yeah, well,” said Harry, glowering at his plate, “since 
when has Snape ever been fair to me?” 

Neither of the others answered; all three of them 
knew that Snape and Harry’s mutual enmity had 
been absolute from the moment Harry had set foot in 
Hogwarts. 

“I did think he might be a bit better this year,” said 
Hermione in a disappointed voice. “I mean ... you 
know ...” She looked carefully around; there were half 
a dozen empty seats on either side of them and 
nobody was passing the table. "... Now he’s in the 
Order and everything.” 

“Poisonous toadstools don’t change their spots,” said 
Ron sagely. “Anyway, I’ve always thought Dumbledore 
was cracked trusting Snape, where’s the evidence he 
ever really stopped working for You-Know-Who?” 

Page | 299Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“I think Dumbledore’s probably got plenty of evidence, 
even if he doesn’t share it with you, Ron,” snapped 
Hermione. 

“Oh, shut up, the pair of you,” said Harry heavily, as 
Ron opened his mouth to argue back. Hermione and 
Ron both froze, looking angry and offended. “Can’t 
you give it a rest?” he said. “You’re always having a go 
at each other, it’s driving me mad.” And abandoning 
his shepherd’s pie, he swung his schoolbag back over 
his shoulder and left them sitting there. 

He walked up the marble staircase two steps at a 
time, past the many students hurrying toward lunch. 
The anger that had just flared so unexpectedly still 
blazed inside him, and the vision of Ron and 
Hermione ’s shocked faces afforded him a sense of 
deep satisfaction. Serve them right, he thought. Why 
can’t they give it a rest? ... Bickering all the time ... It’s 
enough to drive anyone up the wall. . . 

He passed the large picture of Sir Cadogan the knight 
on a landing; Sir Cadogan drew his sword and 
brandished it fiercely at Harry, who ignored him. 

“Come back, you scurvy dog, stand fast and fight!” 
yelled Sir Cadogan in a muffled voice from behind his 
visor, but Harry merely walked on, and when Sir 
Cadogan attempted to follow him by running into a 
neighboring picture, he was rebuffed by its 
inhabitant, a large and angry-looking wolfhound. 

Harry spent the rest of the lunch hour sitting alone 
underneath the trapdoor at the top of North Tower, 
and consequently he was the first to ascend the silver 
ladder that led to Sibyll Trelawney’s classroom when 
the bell rang. 



Page | 300Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Divination was Harry’s least favorite class after 
Potions, which was due mainly to Professor 
Trelawney’s habit of predicting his premature death 
every few lessons. A thin woman, heavily draped in 
shawls and glittering with strings of beads, she 
always reminded Harry of some kind of insect, with 
her glasses hugely magnifying her eyes. She was busy 
putting copies of battered, leather-bound books on 
each of the spindly little tables with which her room 
was littered when Harry entered the room, but so dim 
was the light cast by the lamps covered by scarves 
and the low-burning, sickly-scented fire that she 
appeared not to notice him as he took a seat in the 
shadows. The rest of the class arrived over the next 
five minutes. Ron emerged from the trapdoor, looked 
around carefully, spotted Harry and made directly for 
him, or as directly as he could while having to wend 
his way between tables, chairs, and overstuffed poufs. 

“Hermione and me have stopped arguing,” he said, 
sitting down beside Harry. 

“Good,” grunted Harry. 

“But Hermione says she thinks it would be nice if you 
stopped taking out your temper on us,” said Ron. 

“I’m not — ” 

“I’m just passing on the message,” said Ron, talking 
over him. “But I reckon she’s right. It’s not our fault 
how Seamus and Snape treat you.” 

“I never said it — ” 

“Good day,” said Professor Trelawney in her usual 
misty, dreamy voice, and Harry broke off, feeling both 
annoyed and slightly ashamed of himself again. “And 
welcome back to Divination. I have, of course, been 

Page | 301Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




following your fortunes most carefully over the 
holidays, and am delighted to see that you have all 
returned to Hogwarts safely — as, of course, I knew 
you would. 

“You will find on the tables before you copies of The 
Dream Oracle, by Inigo Imago. Dream interpretation is 
a most important means of divining the future and 
one that may very probably be tested in your O.W.L. 
Not, of course, that I believe examination passes or 
failures are of the remotest importance when it comes 
to the sacred art of divination. If you have the Seeing 
Eye, certificates and grades matter very little. 

However, the headmaster likes you to sit the 
examination, so ...” 

Her voice trailed away delicately, leaving them all in 
no doubt that Professor Trelawney considered her 
subject above such sordid matters as examinations. 

“Turn, please, to the introduction and read what 
Imago has to say on the matter of dream 
interpretation. Then divide into pairs. Use The Dream 
Oracle to interpret each other’s most recent dreams. 
Carry on.” 

The one good thing to be said for this lesson was that 
it was not a double period. By the time they had all 
finished reading the introduction of the book, they 
had barely ten minutes left for dream interpretation. 
At the table next to Harry and Ron, Dean had paired 
up with Neville, who immediately embarked on a long- 
winded explanation of a nightmare involving a pair of 
giant scissors wearing his grandmother’s best hat; 
Harry and Ron merely looked at each other glumly. 

“I never remember my dreams,” said Ron. “You say 
one.” 



Page | 302Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“You must remember one of them,” said Harry 
impatiently. 

He was not going to share his dreams with anyone. 

He knew perfectly well what his regular nightmare 
about a graveyard meant, he did not need Ron or 
Professor Trelawney or the stupid Dream Oracle to tell 
him that... 

“Well, I had one that I was playing Quidditch the 
other night,” said Ron, screwing up his face in an 
effort to remember. “What d’you reckon that means?” 

“Probably that you’re going to be eaten by a giant 
marshmallow or something,” said Harry, turning the 
pages of The Dream Oracle without interest. 

It was very dull work looking up bits of dreams in the 
Oracle and Harry was not cheered up when Professor 
Trelawney set them the task of keeping a dream diary 
for a month as homework. When the bell went, he 
and Ron led the way back down the ladder, Ron 
grumbling loudly. 

“D’you realize how much homework we’ve got 
already? Binns set us a foot-and-a-half-long essay on 
giant wars, Snape wants a foot on the use of 
moonstones, and now we’ve got a month’s dream 
diary from Trelawney! Fred and George weren’t wrong 
about O.W.L. year, were they? That Umbridge woman 
had better not give us any...” 

When they entered the Defense Against the Dark Arts 
classroom they found Professor Umbridge already 
seated at the teacher’s desk, wearing the fluffy pink 
cardigan of the night before and the black velvet bow 
on top of her head. Harry was again reminded forcibly 
of a large fly perched unwisely on top of an even 
larger toad. 

Page | 303Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




The class was quiet as it entered the room; Professor 
Umbridge was, as yet, an unknown quantity and 
nobody knew yet how strict a disciplinarian she was 
likely to be. 

“Well, good afternoon!” she said when finally the 
whole class had sat down. 

A few people mumbled “Good afternoon,” in reply. 

“Tut, tut,” said Professor Umbridge. “That won’t do, 
now, will it? I should like you, please, to reply ‘Good 
afternoon, Professor Umbridge.’ One more time, 
please. Good afternoon, class!” 

“Good afternoon, Professor Umbridge,” they chanted 
back at her. 

“There, now,” said Professor Umbridge sweetly. “That 
wasn’t too difficult, was it? Wands away and quills 
out, please.” 

Many of the class exchanged gloomy looks; the order 
“wands away” had never yet been followed by a lesson 
they had found interesting. Harry shoved his wand 
back inside his bag and pulled out quill, ink, and 
parchment. Professor Umbridge opened her handbag, 
extracted her own wand, which was an unusually 
short one, and tapped the blackboard sharply with it; 
words appeared on the board at once: 

Defense Against the Dark Arts 

A Return to Basic Principles. 

“Well now, your teaching in this subject has been 
rather disrupted and fragmented, hasn’t it?” stated 
Professor Umbridge, turning to face the class with her 
hands clasped neatly in front of her. “The constant 

Page | 304Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




changing of teachers, many of whom do not seem to 
have followed any Ministry-approved curriculum, has 
unfortunately resulted in your being far below the 
standard we would expect to see in your O.W.L. year. 

“You will be pleased to know, however, that these 
problems are now to be rectified. We will be following 
a carefully structured, theory-centered, Ministry- 
approved course of defensive magic this year. Copy 
down the following, please.” 

She rapped the blackboard again; the first message 
vanished and was replaced by: 

Course aims: 

1. Understanding the principles underlying 
defensive magic. 

2. Learning to recognize situations in which 
defensive magic can legally be used. 

3. Placing the use of defensive magic in a context 
for practical use. 

For a couple of minutes the room was full of the 
sound of scratching quills on parchment. When 
everyone had copied down Professor Umbridge’s three 
course aims she said, “Has everybody got a copy of 
Defensive Magical Theory by Wilbert Slinkhard?” 

There was a dull murmur of assent throughout the 
class. 

“I think well try that again,” said Professor Umbridge. 
“When I ask you a question, I should like you to reply 
‘Yes, Professor Umbridge,’ or ‘No, Professor 
Umbridge.’ So, has everyone got a copy of Defensive 
Magical Theory by Wilbert Slinkhard?” 

Page | 305Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Yes, Professor Umbridge,” rang through the room. 



“Good,” said Professor Umbridge. “I should like you to 
turn to page five and read chapter one, ‘Basics for 
Beginners.’ There will be no need to talk.” 

Professor Umbridge left the blackboard and settled 
herself in the chair behind the teacher’s desk, 
observing them all with those pouchy toad’s eyes. 
Harry turned to page five of his copy of Defensive 
Magical Theory and started to read. 

It was desperately dull, quite as bad as listening to 
Professor Binns. He felt his concentration sliding 
away from him; he had soon read the same line half a 
dozen times without taking in more than the first few 
words. Several silent minutes passed. Next to him, 

Ron was absent-mindedly turning his quill over and 
over in his fingers, staring at the same spot on the 
page. Harry looked right and received a surprise to 
shake him out of his torpor. Hermione had not even 
opened her copy of Defensive Magical Theory. She was 
staring fixedly at Professor Umbridge with her hand 
in the air. 

Harry could not remember Hermione ever neglecting 
to read when instructed to, or indeed resisting the 
temptation to open any book that came under her 
nose. He looked at her questioningly, but she merely 
shook her head slightly to indicate that she was not 
about to answer questions, and continued to stare at 
Professor Umbridge, who was looking just as 
resolutely in another direction. 

After several more minutes had passed, however, 
Harry was not the only one watching Hermione. The 
chapter they had been instructed to read was so 
tedious that more and more people were choosing to 
watch Hermione’s mute attempt to catch Professor 
Page | 306Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Umbridge’s eye than to struggle on with “Basics for 
Beginners.” 

When more than half the class were staring at 
Hermione rather than at their books, Professor 
Umbridge seemed to decide that she could ignore the 
situation no longer. 

“Did you want to ask something about the chapter, 
dear?” she asked Hermione, as though she had only 
just noticed her. 

“Not about the chapter, no,” said Hermione. 

“Well, we’re reading just now,” said Professor 
Umbridge, showing her small, pointed teeth. “If you 
have other queries we can deal with them at the end 
of class.” 

“I’ve got a query about your course aims,” said 
Hermione. 

Professor Umbridge raised her eyebrows. 

“And your name is — ?” 

“Hermione Granger,” said Hermione. 

“Well, Miss Granger, I think the course aims are 
perfectly clear if you read them through carefully,” 
said Professor Umbridge in a voice of determined 
sweetness. 

“Well, I don’t,” said Hermione bluntly. “There’s 
nothing written up there about using defensive 
spells.” 



Page | 307Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




There was a short silence in which many members of 
the class turned their heads to frown at the three 
course aims still written on the blackboard. 

“ Using defensive spells?” Professor Umbridge repeated 
with a little laugh. “Why, I can’t imagine any situation 
arising in my classroom that would require you to use 
a defensive spell, Miss Granger. You surely aren’t 
expecting to be attacked during class?” 

“We’re not going to use magic?” Ron ejaculated loudly. 

“Students raise their hands when they wish to speak 
in my class, Mr. — ?” 

“Weasley,” said Ron, thrusting his hand into the air. 

Professor Umbridge, smiling still more widely, turned 
her back on him. Harry and Hermione immediately 
raised their hands too. Professor Umbridge’s pouchy 
eyes lingered on Harry for a moment before she 
addressed Hermione. 

“Yes, Miss Granger? You wanted to ask something 
else?” 

“Yes,” said Hermione. “Surely the whole point of 
Defense Against the Dark Arts is to practice defensive 
spells?” 

“Are you a Ministry-trained educational expert, Miss 
Granger?” asked Professor Umbridge in her falsely 
sweet voice. 

“No, but — ” 

“Well then, I’m afraid you are not qualified to decide 
what the Svhole point’ of any class is. Wizards much 
older and cleverer than you have devised our new 

Page | 308Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




program of study. You will be learning about 
defensive spells in a secure, risk-free way — ” 

“What use is that?” said Harry loudly. “If we’re going 
to be attacked it won’t be in a — ” 

“Hand, Mr. Potter!” sang Professor Umbridge. 

Harry thrust his fist in the air. Professor Umbridge 
promptly turned away from him again, but now 
several other people had their hands up too. 

“And your name is?” Professor Umbridge said to 
Dean. 

“Dean Thomas.” 

“Well, Mr. Thomas?” 

“Well, it’s like Harry said, isn’t it?” said Dean. “If we’re 
going to be attacked, it won’t be risk-free — ” 

“I repeat,” said Professor Umbridge, smiling in a very 
irritating fashion at Dean, “do you expect to be 
attacked during my classes?” 

“No, but — ” 

Professor Umbridge talked over him. 

“I do not wish to criticize the way things have been 
run in this school,” she said, an unconvincing smile 
stretching her wide mouth, “but you have been 
exposed to some very irresponsible wizards in this 
class, very irresponsible indeed — not to mention,” 
she gave a nasty little laugh, “extremely dangerous 
half-breeds.” 



Page | 309Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“If you mean Professor Lupin,” piped up Dean 
Thomas angrily, “he was the best we ever — ” 

“Hand, Mr. Thomas! As I was saying — you have been 
introduced to spells that have been complex, 
inappropriate to your age group, and potentially 
lethal. You have been frightened into believing that 
you are likely to meet Dark attacks every other day — 



“No we haven’t,” Hermione said, “we just — ” 

“Your hand is not up, Miss Grangeii” 

Hermione put up her hand; Professor Umbridge 
turned away from her. 

“It is my understanding that my predecessor not only 
performed illegal curses in front of you, he actually 
performed them on you — ” 

“Well, he turned out to be a maniac, didn’t he?” said 
Dean Thomas hotly. “Mind you, we still learned loads 



“Your hand is not up, Mr. ThomasY trilled Professor 
Umbridge. “Now, it is the view of the Ministry that a 
theoretical knowledge will be more than sufficient to 
get you through your examination, which, after all, is 
what school is all about. And your name is?” she 
added, staring at Parvati, whose hand had just shot 
up. 

“Parvati Patil, and isn’t there a practical bit in our 
Defense Against the Dark Arts O.W.L.? Aren’t we 
supposed to show that we can actually do the 
countercurses and things?” 



Page | 310Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“As long as you have studied the theory hard enough, 
there is no reason why you should not be able to 
perform the spells under carefully controlled 
examination conditions,” said Professor Umbridge 
dismissively. 

“Without ever practicing them before?” said Parvati 
incredulously. “Are you telling us that the first time 
we’ll get to do the spells will be during our exam?” 

“I repeat, as long as you have studied the theory hard 
enough — ” 

“And what good’s theory going to be in the real 
world?” said Harry loudly, his fist in the air again. 

Professor Umbridge looked up. 

“This is school, Mr. Potter, not the real world,” she 
said softly. 

“So we’re not supposed to be prepared for what’s 
waiting out there?” 

“There is nothing waiting out there, Mr. Potter.” 

“Oh yeah?” said Harry. His temper, which seemed to 
have been bubbling just beneath the surface all day, 
was reaching boiling point. 

“Who do you imagine wants to attack children like 
yourselves?” inquired Professor Umbridge in a 
horribly honeyed voice. 

“Hmm, let’s think ...” said Harry in a mock thoughtful 
voice, “maybe Lord Voldemort?” 

Ron gasped; Lavender Brown uttered a little scream; 
Neville slipped sideways off his stool. Professor 

Page | 311Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Umbridge, however, did not flinch. She was staring at 
Harry with a grimly satisfied expression on her face. 



“Ten points from Gryffindor, Mr. Potter.” 

The classroom was silent and still. Everyone was 
staring at either Umbridge or Harry. 

“Now, let me make a few things quite plain.” 

Professor Umbridge stood up and leaned toward 
them, her stubby-fingered hands splayed on her desk. 

“You have been told that a certain Dark wizard has 
returned from the dead — ” 

“He wasn’t dead,” said Harry angrily, “but yeah, he’s 
returned!” 

“Mr.-Potter-you-have-already-lost-your-House-ten- 
points-do-not-make-matters-worse-for-yourself,” said 
Professor Umbridge in one breath without looking at 
him. “As I was saying, you have been informed that a 
certain Dark wizard is at large once again. This is a 
lie.” 

“It is NOT a lie!” said Harry. “I saw him, I fought him!” 

“Detention, Mr. Potter!” said Professor Umbridge 
triumphantly. “Tomorrow evening. Five o’clock. My 
office. I repeat, this is a lie. The Ministry of Magic 
guarantees that you are not in danger from any Dark 
wizard. If you are still worried, by all means come and 
see me outside class hours. If someone is alarming 
you with fibs about reborn Dark wizards, I would like 
to hear about it. I am here to help. I am your friend. 
And now, you will kindly continue your reading. Page 
five, ‘Basics for Beginners.’ ” 

Page | 312Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Professor Umbridge sat down behind her desk again. 
Harry, however, stood up. Everyone was staring at 
him; Seamus looked half-scared, half-fascinated. 

“Harry, no!” Hermione whispered in a warning voice, 
tugging at his sleeve, but Harry jerked his arm out of 
her reach. 

“So, according to you, Cedric Diggory dropped dead of 
his own accord, did he?” Harry asked, his voice 
shaking. 

There was a collective intake of breath from the class, 
for none of them, apart from Ron and Hermione, had 
ever heard Harry talk about what had happened on 
the night that Cedric had died. They stared avidly 
from Harry to Professor Umbridge, who had raised 
her eyes and was staring at him without a trace of a 
fake smile on her face. 

“Cedric Diggory’s death was a tragic accident,” she 
said coldly. 

“It was murder,” said Harry. He could feel himself 
shaking. He had hardly talked to anyone about this, 
least of all thirty eagerly listening classmates. 
“Voldemort killed him, and you know it.” 

Professor Umbridge’s face was quite blank. For a 
moment he thought she was going to scream at him. 
Then she said, in her softest, most sweetly girlish 
voice, “Come here, Mr. Potter, dear.” 

He kicked his chair aside, strode around Ron and 
Hermione and up to the teacher’s desk. He could feel 
the rest of the class holding its breath. He felt so 
angry he did not care what happened next. 



Page | 313Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Professor Umbridge pulled a small roll of pink 
parchment out of her handbag, stretched it out on the 
desk, dipped her quill into a bottle of ink, and started 
scribbling, hunched over so that Harry could not see 
what she was writing. Nobody spoke. After a minute 
or so she rolled up the parchment and tapped it with 
her wand; it sealed itself seamlessly so that he could 
not open it. 

“Take this to Professor McGonagall, dear,” said 
Professor Umbridge, holding out the note to him. 

He took it from her without saying a word and left the 
room, not even looking back at Ron and Hermione, 
and slamming the classroom door shut behind him. 
He walked very fast along the corridor, the note to 
McGonagall clutched tight in his hand, and turning a 
corner walked slap into Peeves the Poltergeist, a wide- 
faced little man floating on his back in midair, 
juggling several inkwells. 

“Why, it’s Potty Wee Potter!” cackled Peeves, allowing 
two of the inkwells to fall to the ground where they 
smashed and spattered the walls with ink; Harry 
jumped backward out of the way with a snarl. 

“Get out of it, Peeves.” 

“Oooh, Crackpot’s feeling cranky,” said Peeves, 
pursuing Harry along the corridor, leering as he 
zoomed along above him. “What is it this time, my 
fine Potty friend? Hearing voices? Seeing visions? 
Speaking in” — Peeves blew a gigantic raspberry — 
“tongues?” 

“I said, leave me ALONE!” Harry shouted, running 
down the nearest flight of stairs, but Peeves merely 
slid down the banister on his back beside him. 



Page | 314Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Oh, most think he’s barking, the Potty wee lad, 

But some are more kindly and think he’s just sad, 

But Peevesy knows better and says that he’s mad — ” 
“SHUT UP!” 

A door to his left flew open and Professor McGonagall 
emerged from her office looking grim and slightly 
harassed. 

“What on earth are you shouting about, Potter?” she 
snapped, as Peeves cackled gleefully and zoomed out 
of sight. “Why aren’t you in class?” 

“I’ve been sent to see you,” said Harry stiffly. 

“Sent? What do you mean, sent?” 

He held out the note from Professor Umbridge. 
Professor McGonagall took it from him, frowning, slit 
it open with a tap of her wand, stretched it out, and 
began to read. Her eyes zoomed from side to side 
behind their square spectacles as she read what 
Umbridge had written, and with each line they 
became narrower. 

“Come in here, Potter.” 

He followed her inside her study. The door closed 
automatically behind him. 

“Well?” said Professor McGonagall, rounding on him. 
“Is this true?” 

“Is what true?” Harry asked, rather more aggressively 
than he had intended. “Professor?” he added in an 
attempt to sound more polite. 

Page | 315Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Is it true that you shouted at Professor Umbridge?” 
“Yes,” said Harry. 

“You called her a liar?” 

“Yes.” 

“You told her He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back?” 
“Yes.” 

Professor McGonagall sat down behind her desk, 
frowning at Harry. Then she said, “Have a biscuit, 
Potter.” 

“Have — what?” 

“Have a biscuit,” she repeated impatiently, indicating 
a tartan tin of cookies lying on top of one of the piles 
of papers on her desk. “And sit down.” 

There had been a previous occasion when Harry, 
expecting to be caned by Professor McGonagall, had 
instead been appointed by her to the Gryffindor 
Quidditch team. He sank into a chair opposite her 
and helped himself to a Ginger Newt, feeling just as 
confused and wrong-footed as he had done on that 
occasion. 

Professor McGonagall set down Professor Umbridge’s 
note and looked very seriously at Harry. 

“Potter, you need to be careful.” 

Harry swallowed his mouthful of Ginger Newt and 
stared at her. Her tone of voice was not at all what he 
was used to; it was not brisk, crisp, and stern; it was 



Page | 316Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




low and anxious and somehow much more human 
than usual. 

“Misbehavior in Dolores Umbridge’s class could cost 
you much more than House points and a detention.” 

“What do you — ?” 

“Potter, use your common sense,” snapped Professor 
McGonagall, with an abrupt return to her usual 
manner. “You know where she comes from, you must 
know to whom she is reporting.” 

The bell rang for the end of the lesson. Overhead and 
all around came the elephantine sounds of hundreds 
of students on the move. 

“It says here she’s given you detention every evening 
this week, starting tomorrow,” Professor McGonagall 
said, looking down at Umbridge’s note again. 

“Every evening this week!” Harry repeated, horrified. 
“But, Professor, couldn’t you — ?” 

“No, I couldn’t,” said Professor McGonagall flatly. 

“But — ” 

“She is your teacher and has every right to give you 
detention. You will go to her room at five o’clock 
tomorrow for the first one. Just remember: Tread 
carefully around Dolores Umbridge.” 

“But I was telling the truth!” said Harry, outraged. 
“Voldemort’s back, you know he is, Professor 
Dumbledore knows he is — ” 

“For heaven’s sake, Potter!” said Professor 
McGonagall, straightening her glasses angrily (she 

Page | 317Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




had winced horribly when he had used Voldemort’s 
name). “Do you really think this is about truth or 
lies? It’s about keeping your head down and your 
temper under control!” 

She stood up, nostrils wide and mouth very thin, and 
he stood too. 

“Have another biscuit,” she said irritably, thrusting 
the tin at him. 

“No, thanks,” said Harry coldly. 

“Don’t be ridiculous,” she snapped. 

He took one. 

“Thanks,” he said grudgingly. 

“Didn’t you listen to Dolores Umbridge’s speech at the 
start-of-term feast, Potter?” 

“Yeah,” said Harry. “Yeah ... she said ... progress will 
be prohibited or ... well, it meant that ... that the 
Ministry of Magic is trying to interfere at Hogwarts.” 

Professor McGonagall eyed him for a moment, then 
sniffed, walked around her desk, and held open the 
door for him. 

“Well, I’m glad you listen to Hermione Granger at any 
rate,” she said, pointing him out of her office. 



Page | 318Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 






DETENTION WITH DOLORES 

Dinner in the Great Hall that night was not a pleasant 
experience for Harry. The news about his shouting 
match with Umbridge seemed to have traveled 
exceptionally fast even by Hogwarts standards. He 
heard whispers all around him as he sat eating 
between Ron and Hermione. The funny thing was that 
none of the whisperers seemed to mind him 
overhearing what they were saying about him — on 
the contrary, it was as though they were hoping he 
would get angry and start shouting again, so that 
they could hear his story firsthand. 

“He says he saw Cedric Diggory murdered...” 

“He reckons he dueled with You-Know-Who...” 

“Come off it...” 

“Who does he think he’s kidding?” 

“Pur - lease ...” 



Page | 319Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 



“What I don’t get,” said Harry in a shaking voice, 
laying down his knife and fork (his hands were 
trembling too much to hold them steady), “is why they 
all believed the story two months ago when 
Dumbledore told them...” 

“The thing is, Harry, I’m not sure they did,” said 
Hermione grimly. “Oh, let’s get out of here.” 

She slammed down her own knife and fork; Ron 
looked sadly at his half-finished apple pie but 
followed suit. People stared at them all the way out of 
the Hall. 

“What d’you mean, you’re not sure they believed 
Dumbledore?” Harry asked Hermione when they 
reached the first-floor landing. 

“Look, you don’t understand what it was like after it 
happened,” said Hermione quietly. “You arrived back 
in the middle of the lawn clutching Cedric’s dead 
body... None of us saw what happened in the maze... 
We just had Dumbledore’s word for it that You-Know- 
Who had come back and killed Cedric and fought 
you.” 

“Which is the truth!” said Harry loudly. 

“I know it is, Harry, so will you please stop biting my 
head off?” said Hermione wearily. “It’s just that before 
the truth could sink in, everyone went home for the 
summer, where they spent two months reading about 
how you’re a nutcase and Dumbledore’s going senile!” 

Rain pounded on the windowpanes as they strode 
along the empty corridors back to Gryffindor Tower. 
Harry felt as though his first day had lasted a week, 
but he still had a mountain of homework to do before 
bed. A dull pounding pain was developing over his 
Page | 320Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




right eye. He glanced out of a rain-washed window at 
the dark grounds as they turned into the Fat Lady’s 
corridor. There was still no light in Hagrid’s cabin. 

“Mimbulus mimbletonia,” said Hermione, before the 
Fat Lady could ask. The portrait swung open to reveal 
the hole behind and the three of them scrambled 
back through it. 

The common room was almost empty; nearly everyone 
was still down at dinner. Crookshanks uncoiled 
himself from an armchair and trotted to meet them, 
purring loudly, and when Harry, Ron, and Hermione 
took their three favorite chairs at the fireside he leapt 
lightly into Hermione ’s lap and curled up there like a 
furry ginger cushion. Harry gazed into the flames, 
feeling drained and exhausted. 

“How can Dumbledore have let this happen?” 
Hermione cried suddenly, making Harry and Ron 
jump; Crookshanks leapt off her, looking affronted. 
She pounded the arms of her chair in fury, so that 
bits of stuffing leaked out of the holes. “How can he 
let that terrible woman teach us? And in our O.W.L. 
year too!” 

“Well, we’ve never had great Defense Against the Dark 
Arts teachers, have we?” said Harry. “You know what 
it’s like, Hagrid told us, nobody wants the job, they 
say it’s jinxed.” 

“Yes, but to employ someone who’s actually refusing 
to let us do magic! What’s Dumbledore playing at?” 

“And she’s trying to get people to spy for her,” said 
Ron darkly. “Remember when she said she wanted us 
to come and tell her if we hear anyone saying You- 
Know- Who’s back?” 



Page | 321Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Of course she’s here to spy on us all, that’s obvious, 
why else would Fudge have wanted her to come?” 
snapped Hermione. 

“Don’t start arguing again,” said Harry wearily, as 
Ron opened his mouth to retaliate. “Can’t we just ... 
Let’s just do that homework, get it out of the way...” 

They collected their schoolbags from a corner and 
returned to the chairs by the fire. People were coming 
back from dinner now. Harry kept his face averted 
from the portrait hole, but could still sense the stares 
he was attracting. 

“Shall we do Snape’s stuff first?” said Ron, dipping 
his quill into his ink. “ ‘The properties ...of moonstone 
... and its uses ...in potion-making ...’ ” he muttered, 
writing the words across the top of his parchment as 
he spoke them. “There.” He underlined the title, then 
looked up expectantly at Hermione. 

“So what are the properties of moonstone and its uses 
in potion-making?” 

But Hermione was not listening; she was squinting 
over into the far corner of the room, where Fred, 
George, and Lee Jordan were now sitting at the center 
of a knot of innocent-looking first years, all of whom 
were chewing something that seemed to have come 
out of a large paper bag that Fred was holding. 

“No, I’m sorry, they’ve gone too far,” she said, 
standing up and looking positively furious. “Come on, 
Ron.” 

“I — what?” said Ron, plainly playing for time. “No — 
come on, Hermione — we can’t tell them off for giving 
out sweets...” 



Page | 322Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“You know perfectly well that those are bits of 
Nosebleed Nougat or — or Puking Pastilles or — ” 

“Fainting Fancies?” Harry suggested quietly. 

One by one, as though hit over the heads with 
invisible mallets, the first years were slumping 
unconscious in their seats; some slid right onto the 
floor, others merely hung over the arms of their 
chairs, their tongues lolling out. Most of the people 
watching were laughing; Hermione, however, squared 
her shoulders and marched directly over to where 
Fred and George now stood with clipboards, closely 
observing the unconscious first years. Ron rose 
halfway out of his chair, hovered uncertainly for a 
moment or two, then muttered to Harry, “She’s got it 
under control,” before sinking as low in his chair as 
his lanky frame permitted. 

“That’s enough!” Hermione said forcefully to Fred and 
George, both of whom looked up in mild surprise. 

“Yeah, you’re right,” said George, nodding, “this 
dosage looks strong enough, doesn’t it?” 

“I told you this morning, you can’t test your rubbish 
on students!” 

“We’re paying them!” said Fred indignantly. 

“I don’t care, it could be dangerous!” 

“Rubbish,” said Fred. 

“Calm down, Hermione, they’re fine!” said Lee 
reassuringly as he walked from first year to first year, 
inserting purple sweets into their open mouths. 

“Yeah, look, they’re coming round now,” said George. 

Page | 323Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




A few of the first years were indeed stirring. Several 
looked so shocked to find themselves lying on the 
floor, or dangling off their chairs, that Harry was sure 
Fred and George had not warned them what the 
sweets were going to do. 

“Feel all right?” said George kindly to a small dark- 
haired girl lying at his feet. 

“I-I think so,” she said shakily. 

“Excellent,” said Fred happily, but the next second 
Hermione had snatched both his clipboard and the 
paper bag of Fainting Fancies from his hands. 

“It is NOT excellent!” 

“ ’Course it is, they’re alive, aren’t they?” said Fred 
angrily. 

“You can’t do this, what if you made one of them 
really ill?” 

“We’re not going to make them ill, we’ve already tested 
them all on ourselves, this is just to see if everyone 
reacts the same — ” 

“If you don’t stop doing it, I’m going to — ” 

“Put us in detention?” said Fred in an I’d-like-to-see- 
you-try-it voice. 

“Make us write lines?” said George, smirking. 

Onlookers all over the room were laughing. Hermione 
drew herself up to her full height; her eyes were 
narrowed and her bushy hair seemed to crackle with 
electricity. 



Page | 324Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“No,” she said, her voice quivering with anger, “but I 
will write to your mother.” 



“You wouldn’t,” said George, horrified, taking a step 
back from her. 

“Oh, yes, I would,” said Hermione grimly. “I can’t stop 
you eating the stupid things yourselves, but you’re 
not giving them to first years.” 

Fred and George looked thunderstruck. It was clear 
that as far as they were concerned, Hermione ’s threat 
was way below the belt. With a last threatening look 
at them, she thrust Fred’s clipboard and the bag of 
Fancies back into his arms and stalked back to her 
chair by the fire. 

Ron was now so low in his seat that his nose was 
roughly level with his knees. 

“Thank you for your support, Ron,” Hermione said 
acidly. 

“You handled it fine by yourself,” Ron mumbled. 

Hermione stared down at her blank piece of 
parchment for a few seconds, then said edgily, “Oh, 
it’s no good, I can’t concentrate now. I’m going to 
bed.” 

She wrenched her bag open; Harry thought she was 
about to put her books away, but instead she pulled 
out two misshapen woolly objects, placed them 
carefully on a table by the fireplace, covered them 
with a few screwed-up bits of parchment and a 
broken quill, and stood back to admire the effect. 

“What in the name of Merlin are you doing?” said 
Ron, watching her as though fearful for her sanity. 

Page | 325Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“They’re hats for house-elves,” she said briskly, now 
stuffing her books back into her bag. “I did them over 
the summer. I’m a really slow knitter without magic, 
but now I’m back at school I should be able to make 
lots more.” 

“You’re leaving out hats for the house-elves?” said 
Ron slowly. “And you’re covering them up with 
rubbish first?” 

“Yes,” said Hermione defiantly, swinging her bag onto 
her back. 

“That’s not on,” said Ron angrily. “You’re trying to 
trick them into picking up the hats. You’re setting 
them free when they might not want to be free.” 

“Of course they want to be free!” said Hermione at 
once, though her face was turning pink. “Don’t you 
dare touch those hats, Ron!” 

She left. Ron waited until she had disappeared 
through the door to the girls’ dormitories, then 
cleared the rubbish off the woolly hats. 

“They should at least see what they’re picking up,” he 
said firmly. “Anyway ...” He rolled up the parchment 
on which he had written the title of Snape’s essay. 
“There’s no point trying to finish this now, I can’t do it 
without Hermione, I haven’t got a clue what you’re 
supposed to do with moonstones, have you?” 

Harry shook his head, noticing as he did so that the 
ache in his right temple was getting worse. He 
thought of the long essay on giant wars and the pain 
stabbed at him sharply. Knowing perfectly well that 
he would regret not finishing his homework tonight 
when the morning came, he piled his books back into 
his bag. 

Page | 326Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




‘Tm going to bed too.” 

He passed Seamus on the way to the door leading to 
the dormitories, but did not look at him. Harry had a 
fleeting impression that Seamus had opened his 
mouth to speak, but sped up, and reached the 
soothing peace of the stone spiral staircase without 
having to endure any more provocation. 

The following day dawned just as leaden and rainy as 
the previous one. Hagrid was still absent from the 
staff table at breakfast. 

“But on the plus side, no Snape today,” said Ron 
bracingly. 

Hermione yawned widely and poured herself some 
coffee. She looked mildly pleased about something, 
and when Ron asked her what she had to be so happy 
about, she simply said, “The hats have gone. Seems 
the house-elves do want freedom after all.” 

“I wouldn’t bet on it,” Ron told her cuttingly. “They 
might not count as clothes. They didn’t look anything 
like hats to me, more like woolly bladders.” 

Hermione did not speak to him all morning. 

Double Charms was succeeded by double 
Transfiguration. Professor Flitwick and Professor 
McGonagall both spent the first fifteen minutes of 
their lessons lecturing the class on the importance of 
O.W.L.s. 

“What you must remember,” said little Professor 
Flitwick squeakily, perched as ever on a pile of books 
so that he could see over the top of his desk, “is that 
these examinations may influence your futures for 
many years to come! If you have not already given 
Page | 327Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




serious thought to your careers, now is the time to do 
so. And in the meantime, I’m afraid, we shall be 
working harder than ever to ensure that you all do 
yourselves justice!” 

They then spent more than an hour reviewing 
Summoning Charms, which according to Professor 
Flitwick were bound to come up in their O.W.L., and 
he rounded off the lesson by setting them their largest 
amount of Charms homework ever. 

It was the same, if not worse, in Transfiguration. 

“You cannot pass an O.W.L.,” said Professor 
McGonagall grimly, “without serious application, 
practice, and study. I see no reason why everybody in 
this class should not achieve an O.W.L. in 
Transfiguration as long as they put in the work.” 
Neville made a sad little disbelieving noise. “Yes, you 
too, Longbottom,” said Professor McGonagall. “There’s 
nothing wrong with your work except lack of 
confidence. So ... today we are starting Vanishing 
Spells. These are easier than Conjuring Spells, which 
you would not usually attempt until N.E.W.T. level, 
but they are still among the most difficult magic you 
will be tested on in your O.W.L.” 

She was quite right; Harry found the Vanishing Spells 
horribly difficult. By the end of a double period, 
neither he nor Ron had managed to vanish the snails 
on which they were practicing, though Ron said 
hopefully that he thought his looked a bit paler. 
Hermione, on the other hand, successfully vanished 
her snail on the third attempt, earning her a ten-point 
bonus for Gryffindor from Professor McGonagall. She 
was the only person not given homework; everybody 
else was told to practice the spell overnight, ready for 
a fresh attempt on their snails the following 
afternoon. 

Page | 328Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Now panicking slightly about the amount of 
homework they had to do, Harry and Ron spent their 
lunch hour in the library looking up the uses of 
moonstones in potion-making. Still angry about Ron’s 
slur on her woolly hats, Hermione did not join them. 
By the time they reached Care of Magical Creatures in 
the afternoon, Harry’s head was aching again. 

The day had become cool and breezy, and, as they 
walked down the sloping lawn toward Hagrid’s cabin 
on the edge of the Forbidden Forest, they felt the 
occasional drop of rain on their faces. Professor 
Grubbly-Plank stood waiting for the class some ten 
yards from Hagrid’s front door, a long trestle table in 
front of her laden with many twigs. As Harry and Ron 
reached her, a loud shout of laughter sounded behind 
them; turning, they saw Draco Malfoy striding toward 
them, surrounded by his usual gang of Slytherin 
cronies. He had clearly just said something highly 
amusing, because Crabbe, Goyle, Pansy Parkinson, 
and the rest continued to snigger heartily as they 
gathered around the trestle table. Judging by the fact 
that all of them kept looking over at Harry, he was 
able to guess the subject of the joke without too much 
difficulty. 

“Everyone here?” barked Professor Grubbly-Plank, 
once all the Slytherins and Gryffindors had arrived. 
“Let’s crack on then — who can tell me what these 
things are called?” 

She indicated the heap of twigs in front of her. 
Hermione ’s hand shot into the air. Behind her back, 
Malfoy did a buck-toothed imitation of her jumping 
up and down in eagerness to answer a question. 

Pansy Parkinson gave a shriek of laughter that turned 
almost at once into a scream, as the twigs on the 
table leapt into the air and revealed themselves to be 
what looked like tiny pixieish creatures made of wood, 
Page | 329Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




each with knobbly brown arms and legs, two twiglike 
fingers at the end of each hand, and a funny, flat, 
barklike face in which a pair of beetle-brown eyes 
glittered. 

“Oooooh!” said Parvati and Lavender, thoroughly 
irritating Harry: Anyone would have thought that 
Hagrid never showed them impressive creatures; 
admittedly the flobberworms had been a bit dull, but 
the salamanders and hippogriffs had been interesting 
enough, and the Blast-Ended Skrewts perhaps too 
much so. 

“Kindly keep your voices down, girls!” said Professor 
Grubbly-Plank sharply, scattering a handful of what 
looked like brown rice among the stick-creatures, who 
immediately fell upon the food. “So — anyone know 
the names of these creatures? Miss Granger?” 

“Bowtruckles,” said Hermione. “They’re tree- 
guardians, usually live in wand-trees.” 

“Five points for Gryffindor,” said Professor Grubbly- 
Plank. “Yes, these are bowtruckles and, as Miss 
Granger rightly says, they generally live in trees 
whose wood is of wand quality. Anybody know what 
they eat?” 

“Wood lice,” said Hermione promptly, which explained 
why what Harry had taken for grains of brown rice 
were moving. “But fairy eggs if they can get them.” 

“Good girl, take another five points. So whenever you 
need leaves or wood from a tree in which a 
bowtruckle lodges, it is wise to have a gift of wood lice 
ready to distract or placate it. They may not look 
dangerous, but if angered they will gouge out human 
eyes with their fingers, which, as you can see, are 
very sharp and not at all desirable near the eyeballs. 
Page | 330Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




So if you’d like to gather closer, take a few wood lice 
and a bowtruckle — I have enough here for one 
between three — you can study them more closely. I 
want a sketch from each of you with all body parts 
labeled by the end of the lesson.” 

The class surged forward around the trestle table. 
Harry deliberately circled around the back so that he 
ended up right next to Professor Grubbly-Plank. 

“Where’s Hagrid?” he asked her, while everyone else 
was choosing bowtruckles. 

“Never you mind,” said Professor Grubbly-Plank 
repressively, which had been her attitude last time 
Hagrid had failed to turn up for a class too. Smirking 
all over his pointed face, Draco Malfoy leaned across 
Harry and seized the largest bowtruckle. 

“Maybe,” said Malfoy in an undertone, so that only 
Harry could hear him, “the stupid great oaf’s got 
himself badly injured.” 

“Maybe you will if you don’t shut up,” said Harry out 
of the side of his mouth. 

“Maybe he’s been messing with stuff that’s too big for 
him, if you get my drift.” 

Malfoy walked away, smirking over his shoulder at 
Harry, who suddenly felt sick. Did Malfoy know 
something? His father was a Death Eater, after all; 
what if he had information about Hagrid ’s fate that 
had not yet reached the Order’s ears? He hurried 
back around the table to Ron and Hermione, who 
were squatting on the grass some distance away and 
attempting to persuade a bowtruckle to remain still 
long enough to draw it. Harry pulled out parchment 



Page | 331Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




and quill, crouched down beside the others, and 
related in a whisper what Malfoy had just said. 

“Dumbledore would know if something had happened 
to Hagrid,” said Hermione at once. “It’s just playing 
into Malfoy’s hands to look worried, it tells him we 
don’t know exactly what’s going on. We’ve got to 
ignore him, Harry. Here, hold the bowtruckle for a 
moment, just so I can draw its face...” 

“Yes,” came Malfoy’s clear drawl from the group 
nearest them, “Father was talking to the Minister just 
a couple of days ago, you know, and it sounds as 
though the Ministry’s really determined to crack down 
on substandard teaching in this place. So even if that 
overgrown moron does show up again, he’ll probably 
be sent packing straight away.” 

“OUCH!” 

Harry had gripped the bowtruckle so hard that it had 
almost snapped; it had just taken a great retaliatory 
swipe at his hand with its sharp fingers, leaving two 
long deep cuts there. Harry dropped it; Crabbe and 
Goyle, who had already been guffawing at the idea of 
Hagrid being sacked, laughed still harder as the 
bowtruckle set off at full tilt toward the forest, a little, 
moving stickman soon swallowed up by the tree roots. 
When the bell echoed distantly over the grounds 
Harry rolled up his bloodstained bowtruckle picture 
and marched off to Herbology with his hand wrapped 
in a handkerchief of Hermione ’s and Malfoy’s derisive 
laughter still ringing in his ears. 

“If he calls Hagrid a moron one more time ...” snarled 
Harry. 



Page | 332Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Harry, don’t go picking a row with Malfoy, don’t 
forget, he’s a prefect now, he could make life difficult 
for you...” 

“Wow, I wonder what it’d be like to have a difficult 
life?” said Harry sarcastically. Ron laughed, but 
Hermione frowned. Together they traipsed across the 
vegetable patch. The sky still appeared unable to 
make up its mind whether it wanted to rain or not. 

“I just wish Hagrid would hurry up and get back, 
that’s all,” said Harry in a low voice, as they reached 
the greenhouses. “And don’t say that Grubbly-Plank 
woman’s a better teacher!” he added threateningly. 

“I wasn’t going to,” said Hermione calmly. 

“Because she’ll never be as good as Hagrid,” said 
Harry firmly, fully aware that he had just experienced 
an exemplary Care of Magical Creatures lesson and 
was thoroughly annoyed about it. 

The door of the nearest greenhouse opened and some 
fourth years spilled out of it, including Ginny. 

“Hi,” she said brightly as she passed. A few seconds 
later, Luna Lovegood emerged, trailing behind the rest 
of the class, a smudge of earth on her nose and her 
hair tied in a knot on the top of her head. When she 
saw Harry, her prominent eyes seemed to bulge 
excitedly and she made a beeline straight for him. 
Many of his classmates turned curiously to watch. 
Luna took a great breath and then said, without so 
much as a preliminary hello: “I believe He-Who-Must- 
Not-Be-Named is back, and I believe you fought him 
and escaped from him.” 

“Er — right,” said Harry awkwardly. Luna was 
wearing what looked like a pair of orange radishes for 

Page | 333Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




earrings, a fact that Parvati and Lavender seemed to 
have noticed, as they were both giggling and pointing 
at her earlobes. 

“You can laugh!” Luna said, her voice rising, 
apparently under the impression that Parvati and 
Lavender were laughing at what she had said rather 
than what she was wearing. “But people used to 
believe there were no such things as the Blibbering 
Humdinger or the Crumple-Horned Snorkack!” 

“Well, they were right, weren’t they?” said Hermione 
impatiently. “There weren’t any such things as the 
Blibbering Humdinger or the Crumple-Horned 
Snorkack.” 

Luna gave her a withering look and flounced away, 
radishes swinging madly. Parvati and Lavender were 
not the only ones hooting with laughter now. 

“D’you mind not offending the only people who believe 
me?” Harry asked Hermione as they made their way 
into class. 

“Oh, for heaven’s sake, Harry, you can do better than 
her,” said Hermione. “Ginny’s told me all about her, 
apparently she’ll only believe in things as long as 
there’s no proof at all. Well, I wouldn’t expect 
anything else from someone whose father runs The 
Quibbler.” 

Harry thought of the sinister winged horses he had 
seen on the night he had arrived and how Luna had 
said she could see them too. His spirits sank slightly. 
Had she been lying? But before he could devote much 
more thought to the matter, Ernie Macmillan had 
stepped up to him.

“I want you to know, Potter,” he said in a loud, 
carrying voice, “that it’s not only weirdos who support 
you. I personally believe you one hundred percent. My 
family have always stood firm behind Dumbledore, 
and so do I.” 

“Er — thanks very much, Ernie,” said Harry, taken 
aback but pleased. Ernie might be pompous on 
occasions like these, but Harry was in a mood to 
deeply appreciate a vote of confidence from somebody 
who was not wearing radishes in their ears. Ernie’s 
words had certainly wiped the smile from Lavender 
Brown’s face and, as he turned to talk to Ron and 
Hermione, Harry caught Seamus’s expression, which 
looked both confused and defiant. 

To nobody’s surprise, Professor Sprout started their 
lesson by lecturing them about the importance of 
O.W.L.s. Harry wished all the teachers would stop 
doing this; he was starting to get an anxious, twisted 
feeling in his stomach every time he remembered how 
much homework he had to do, a feeling that 
worsened dramatically when Professor Sprout gave 
them yet another essay at the end of class. Tired and 
smelling strongly of dragon dung, Professor Sprout’s 
preferred brand of fertilizer, the Gryffindors trooped 
back up to the castle an hour and a half later, none of 
them talking very much; it had been another long 
day. 

As Harry was starving, and he had his first detention 
with Umbridge at five o’clock, he headed straight for 
dinner without dropping off his bag in Gryffindor 
Tower so that he could bolt something down before 
facing whatever she had in store for him. He had 
barely reached the entrance of the Great Hall, 
however, when a loud and angry voice said, “Oy, 
Potter!” 



Page | 335Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“What now?” he muttered wearily, turning to face 
Angelina Johnson, who looked as though she was in a 
towering temper. 

“I’ll tell you what now,” she said, marching straight 
up to him and poking him hard in the chest with her 
finger. “How come you’ve landed yourself in detention 
for five o’clock on Friday?” 

“What?” said Harry. “Why ... oh yeah, Keeper tryouts!” 

“Now he remembers!” snarled Angelina. “Didn’t I tell 
you I wanted to do a tryout with the whole team, and 
find someone who fitted in with everyone? Didn’t I tell 
you I’d booked the Quidditch pitch specially? And 
now you’ve decided you’re not going to be there!” 

“I didn’t decide not to be there!” said Harry, stung by 
the injustice of these words. “I got detention from that 
Umbridge woman, just because I told her the truth 
about You-Know-Who — ” 

“Well, you can just go straight to her and ask her to 
let you off on Friday,” said Angelina fiercely, “and I 
don’t care how you do it, tell her You-Know-Who ’s a 
figment of your imagination if you like, just make sure 
you’re therel” 

She stormed away. 

“You know what?” Harry said to Ron and Hermione as 
they entered the Great Hall. “I think we’d better check 
with Puddlemere United whether Oliver Wood’s been 
killed during a training session, because she seems to 
be channeling his spirit.” 

“What d’you reckon are the odds of Umbridge letting 
you off on Friday?” said Ron skeptically, as they sat 
down at the Gryffindor table. 

Page | 336Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Less than zero,” said Harry glumly, tipping lamb 
chops onto his plate and starting to eat. “Better try, 
though, hadn’t I? I’ll offer to do two more detentions 
or something, I dunno...” He swallowed a mouthful of 
potato and added, “I hope she doesn’t keep me too 
long this evening. You realize we’ve got to write three 
essays, practice Vanishing Spells for McGonagall, 
work out a countercharm for Flitwick, finish the 
bowtruckle drawing, and start that stupid dream 
diary for Trelawney?” 

Ron moaned and for some reason glanced up at the 
ceiling. 

“And it looks like it’s going to rain.” 

“What’s that got to do with our homework?” said 
Hermione, her eyebrows raised. 

“Nothing,” said Ron at once, his ears reddening. 

At five to five Harry bade the other two good-bye and 
set off for Umbridge’s office on the third floor. When 
he knocked on the door she said, “Come in,” in a 
sugary voice. He entered cautiously, looking around. 

He had known this office under three of its previous 
occupants. In the days when Gilderoy Lockhart had 
lived here it had been plastered in beaming portraits 
of its owner. When Lupin had occupied it, it was likely 
you would meet some fascinating Dark creature in a 
cage or tank if you came to call. In the impostor 
Moody’s days it had been packed with various 
instruments and artifacts for the detection of 
wrongdoing and concealment. 

Now, however, it looked totally unrecognizable. The 
surfaces had all been draped in lacy covers and 
cloths. There were several vases full of dried flowers, 

Page | 337Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




each residing on its own doily, and on one of the walls 
was a collection of ornamental plates, each decorated 
with a large technicolor kitten wearing a different bow 
around its neck. These were so foul that Harry stared 
at them, transfixed, until Professor Umbridge spoke 
again. 

“Good evening, Mr. Potter.” 

Harry started and looked around. He had not noticed 
her at first because she was wearing a luridly 
flowered set of robes that blended only too well with 
the tablecloth on the desk behind her. 

“Evening,” Harry said stiffly. 

“Well, sit down,” she said, pointing toward a small 
table draped in lace beside which she had drawn up a 
straight-backed chair. A piece of blank parchment lay 
on the table, apparently waiting for him. 

“Er,” said Harry, without moving. “Professor 
Umbridge? Er — before we start, I-I wanted to ask 
you a ... a favor.” 

Her bulging eyes narrowed. 

“Oh yes?” 

“Well I’m ... I’m on the Gryffindor Quidditch team. 

And I was supposed to be at the tryouts for the new 
Keeper at five o’clock on Friday and I was — was 
wondering whether I could skip detention that night 
and do it — do it another night ... instead ...” 

He knew long before he reached the end of his 
sentence that it was no good. 



Page | 338Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Oh no,” said Umbridge, smiling so widely that she 
looked as though she had just swallowed a 
particularly juicy fly. “Oh no, no, no. This is your 
punishment for spreading evil, nasty, attention- 
seeking stories, Mr. Potter, and punishments 
certainly cannot be adjusted to suit the guilty one’s 
convenience. No, you will come here at five o’clock 
tomorrow, and the next day, and on Friday too, and 
you will do your detentions as planned. I think it 
rather a good thing that you are missing something 
you really want to do. It ought to reinforce the lesson I 
am trying to teach you.” 

Harry felt the blood surge to his head and heard a 
thumping noise in his ears. So he told evil, nasty, 
attention-seeking stories, did he? 

She was watching him with her head slightly to one 
side, still smiling widely, as though she knew exactly 
what he was thinking and was waiting to see whether 
he would start shouting again. With a massive effort 
Harry looked away from her, dropped his schoolbag 
beside the straight-backed chair, and sat down. 

“There,” said Umbridge sweetly, “we’re getting better 
at controlling our temper already, aren’t we? Now, you 
are going to be doing some lines for me, Mr. Potter. 

No, not with your quill,” she added, as Harry bent 
down to open his bag. “You’re going to be using a 
rather special one of mine. Here you are.” 

She handed him a long, thin black quill with an 
unusually sharp point. 

“I want you to write ‘ I must not tell lies,’ ” she told him 
softly. 

“How many times?” Harry asked, with a creditable 
imitation of politeness. 

Page | 339Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Oh, as long as it takes for the message to sink in,” 
said Umbridge sweetly. “Off you go.” 

She moved over to her desk, sat down, and bent over 
a stack of parchment that looked like essays for 
marking. Harry raised the sharp black quill and then 
realized what was missing. 

“You haven’t given me any ink,” he said. 

“Oh, you won’t need ink,” said Professor Umbridge 
with the merest suggestion of a laugh in her voice. 

Harry placed the point of the quill on the paper and 
wrote: I must not tell lies. 

He let out a gasp of pain. The words had appeared on 
the parchment in what appeared to be shining red 
ink. At the same time, the words had appeared on the 
back of Harry’s right hand, cut into his skin as 
though traced there by a scalpel — yet even as he 
stared at the shining cut, the skin healed over again, 
leaving the place where it had been slightly redder 
than before but quite smooth. 

Harry looked around at Umbridge. She was watching 
him, her wide, toadlike mouth stretched in a smile. 

“Yes?” 

“Nothing,” said Harry quietly. 

He looked back at the parchment, placed the quill 
upon it once more, wrote I must not tell lies, and felt 
the searing pain on the back of his hand for a second 
time; once again the words had been cut into his 
skin, once again they healed over seconds later. 



Page | 340Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




And on it went. Again and again Harry wrote the 
words on the parchment in what he soon came to 
realize was not ink, but his own blood. And again and 
again the words were cut into the back of his hand, 
healed, and then reappeared the next time he set quill 
to parchment. 

Darkness fell outside Umbridge’s window. Harry did 
not ask when he would be allowed to stop. He did not 
even check his watch. He knew she was watching him 
for signs of weakness and he was not going to show 
any, not even if he had to sit here all night, cutting 
open his own hand with this quill... 

“Come here,” she said, after what seemed hours. 

He stood up. His hand was stinging painfully. When 
he looked down at it he saw that the cut had healed, 
but that the skin there was red raw. 

“Hand,” she said. 

He extended it. She took it in her own. Harry 
repressed a shudder as she touched him with her 
thick, stubby fingers on which she wore a number of 
ugly old rings. 

“Tut, tut, I don’t seem to have made much of an 
impression yet,” she said, smiling. “Well, we’ll just 
have to try again tomorrow evening, won’t we? You 
may go.” 

Harry left her office without a word. The school was 
quite deserted; it was surely past midnight. He 
walked slowly up the corridor then, when he had 
turned the corner and was sure that she would not 
hear him, broke into a run. 



Page | 341Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




He had not had time to practice Vanishing Spells, had 
not written a single dream in his dream diary, and 
had not finished the drawing of the bowtruckle, nor 
had he written his essays. He skipped breakfast next 
morning to scribble down a couple of made-up 
dreams for Divination, their first lesson, and was 
surprised to find a disheveled Ron keeping him 
company. 

“How come you didn’t do it last night?” Harry asked, 
as Ron stared wildly around the common room for 
inspiration. Ron, who had been fast asleep when 
Harry got back to the dormitory, muttered something 
about “doing other stuff,” bent low over his 
parchment, and scrawled a few words. 

“That’ll have to do,” he said, slamming the diary shut, 
“I’ve said I dreamed I was buying a new pair of shoes, 
she can’t make anything weird out of that, can she?” 

They hurried off to North Tower together. 

“How was detention with Umbridge, anyway? What 
did she make you do?” 

Harry hesitated for a fraction of a second, then said, 
“Lines.” 

“That’s not too bad, then, eh?” said Ron. 

“Nope,” said Harry. 

“Hey — I forgot — did she let you off for Friday?” 

“No,” said Harry. 

Ron groaned sympathetically. 



Page | 342Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




It was another bad day for Harry; he was one of the 
worst in Transfiguration, not having practiced 
Vanishing Spells at all. He had to give up his lunch 
hour to complete the picture of the bowtruckle, and 
meanwhile, Professors McGonagall, Grubbly-Plank, 
and Sinistra gave them yet more homework, which he 
had no prospect of finishing that evening because of 
his second detention with Umbridge. To cap it all, 
Angelina Johnson tracked him down at dinner again 
and, on learning that he would not be able to attend 
Friday’s Keeper tryouts, told him she was not at all 
impressed by his attitude and that she expected 
players who wished to remain on the team to put 
training before their other commitments. 

“I’m in detention!” Harry yelled after her as she 
stalked away. “D’you think I’d rather be stuck in a 
room with that old toad or playing Quidditch?” 

“At least it’s only lines,” said Hermione consolingly, as 
Harry sank back onto his bench and looked down at 
his steak-and-kidney pie, which he no longer fancied 
very much. “It’s not as if it’s a dreadful punishment, 
really...” 

Harry opened his mouth, closed it again, and nodded. 
He was not really sure why he was not telling Ron 
and Hermione exactly what was happening in 
Umbridge ’s room: He only knew that he did not want 
to see their looks of horror; that would make the 
whole thing seem worse and therefore more difficult 
to face. He also felt dimly that this was between 
himself and Umbridge, a private battle of wills, and he 
was not going to give her the satisfaction of hearing 
that he had complained about it. 

“I can’t believe how much homework we’ve got,” said 
Ron miserably. 



Page | 343Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Well, why didn’t you do any last night?” Hermione 
asked him. “Where were you anyway?” 



“I was ... I fancied a walk,” said Ron shiftily. 

Harry had the distinct impression that he was not 
alone in concealing things at the moment. 

k k k 



The second detention was just as bad as the previous 
one. The skin on the back of Harry’s hand became 
irritated more quickly now, red and inflamed; Harry 
thought it unlikely to keep healing as effectively for 
long. Soon the cut would remain etched in his hand 
and Umbridge would, perhaps, be satisfied. He let no 
moan of pain escape him, however, and from the 
moment of entering the room to the moment of his 
dismissal, again past midnight, he said nothing but 
“Good evening” and “Good night.” 

His homework situation, however, was now desperate, 
and when he returned to the Gryffindor common 
room he did not, though exhausted, go to bed, but 
opened his books and began Snape’s moonstone 
essay. It was half-past two by the time he had 
finished it. He knew he had done a poor job, but there 
was no help for it; unless he had something to give in 
he would be in detention with Snape next. He then 
dashed off answers to the questions Professor 
McGonagall had set them, cobbled together 
something on the proper handling of bowtruckles for 
Professor Grubbly-Plank, and staggered up to bed, 
where he fell fully clothed on top of the bed covers 
and fell asleep immediately. 

Thursday passed in a haze of tiredness. Ron seemed 
very sleepy too, though Harry could not see why he 

Page | 344Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




should be. Harry’s third detention passed in the same 
way as the previous two, except that after two hours 
the words “I must not tell lies” did not fade from the 
back of Harry’s hand, but remained scratched there, 
oozing droplets of blood. The pause in the pointed 
quill’s scratching made Professor Umbridge look up. 

“Ah,” she said softly, moving around her desk to 
examine his hand herself. “Good. That ought to serve 
as a reminder to you, oughtn’t it? You may leave for 
tonight.” 

“Do I still have to come back tomorrow?” said Harry, 
picking up his schoolbag with his left hand rather 
than his smarting right. 

“Oh yes,” said Professor Umbridge, smiling widely as 
before. “Yes, I think we can etch the message a little 
deeper with another evening’s work.” 

He had never before considered the possibility that 
there might be another teacher in the world he hated 
more than Snape, but as he walked back toward 
Gryffindor Tower he had to admit he had found a 
contender. She’s evil, he thought, as he climbed a 
staircase to the seventh floor, she’s an evil, twisted, 
mad, old — 

“Ron?” 

He had reached the top of the stairs, turned right, 
and almost walked into Ron, who was lurking behind 
a statue of Lachlan the Lanky, clutching his 
broomstick. He gave a great leap of surprise when he 
saw Harry and attempted to hide his new Cleansweep 
Eleven behind his back. 

“What are you doing?” 



Page | 345Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Er — nothing. What are you doing?” 

Harry frowned at him. 

“Come on, you can tell me! What are you hiding here 
for?” 

“I’m — I’m hiding from Fred and George, if you must 
know,” said Ron. “They just went past with a bunch 
of first years, I bet they’re testing stuff on them again, 

I mean, they can’t do it in the common room now, can 
they, not with Hermione there.” 

He was talking in a very fast, feverish way. 

“But what have you got your broom for, you haven’t 
been flying, have you?” Harry asked. 

“I — well — well, okay, I’ll tell you, but don’t laugh, all 
right?” Ron said defensively, turning redder with 
every second. “I-I thought I’d try out for Gryffindor 
Keeper now I’ve got a decent broom. There. Go on. 
Laugh.” 

“I’m not laughing,” said Harry. Ron blinked. “It’s a 
brilliant idea! It’d be really cool if you got on the team! 
I’ve never seen you play Keeper, are you good?” 

“I’m not bad,” said Ron, who looked immensely 
relieved at Harry’s reaction. “Charlie, Fred, and 
George always made me Keep for them when they 
were training during the holidays.” 

“So you’ve been practicing tonight?” 

“Every evening since Tuesday ... just on my own, 
though, I’ve been trying to bewitch Quaffles to fly at 
me, but it hasn’t been easy and I don’t know how 
much use it’ll be.” Ron looked nervous and anxious. 

Page | 346Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Fred and George are going to laugh themselves 
stupid when I turn up for the tryouts. They haven’t 
stopped taking the mickey out of me since I got made 
a prefect.” 

“I wish I was going to be there,” said Harry bitterly, as 
they set off together toward the common room. 

“Yeah, so do — Harry, what’s that on the back of your 
hand?” 

Harry, who had just scratched his nose with his free 
right hand, tried to hide it, but had as much success 
as Ron with his Cleans weep. 

“It’s just a cut — it’s nothing — it’s — ” 

But Ron had grabbed Harry’s forearm and pulled the 
back of Harry’s hand up level with his eyes. There 
was a pause, during which he stared at the words 
carved into the skin, then he released Harry, looking 
sick. 

“I thought you said she was giving you lines?” 

Harry hesitated, but after all, Ron had been honest 
with him, so he told Ron the truth about the hours he 
had been spending in Umbridge’s office. 

“The old hag!” Ron said in a revolted whisper as they 
came to a halt in front of the Fat Lady, who was 
dozing peacefully with her head against her frame. 
“She’s sick! Go to McGonagall, say something!” 

“No,” said Harry at once. “I’m not giving her the 
satisfaction of knowing she’s got to me.” 

“Got to you? You can’t let her get away with this!” 



Page | 347Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“I don’t know how much power McGonagall’s got over 
her,” said Harry. 

“Dumbledore, then, tell Dumbledore!” 

“No,” said Harry flatly. 

“Why not?” 

“He’s got enough on his mind,” said Harry, but that 
was not the true reason. He was not going to go to 
Dumbledore for help when Dumbledore had not 
spoken to him once since last June. 

“Well, I reckon you should — ” Ron began, but he was 
interrupted by the Fat Lady, who had been watching 
them sleepily and now burst out, “Are you going to 
give me the password or will I have to stay awake all 
night waiting for you to finish your conversation?” 

Friday dawned sullen and sodden as the rest of the 
week. Though Harry glanced toward the staff table 
automatically when he entered the Great Hall, it was 
without real hope of seeing Hagrid and he turned his 
mind immediately to his more pressing problems, 
such as the mountainous pile of homework he had to 
do and the prospect of yet another detention with 
Umbridge. 

Two things sustained Harry that day. One was the 
thought that it was almost the weekend; the other 
was that, dreadful though his final detention with 
Umbridge was sure to be, he had a distant view of the 
Quidditch pitch from her window and might, with 
luck, be able to see something of Ron’s tryout. These 
were rather feeble rays of light, it was true, but Harry 
was grateful for anything that might lighten his 
present darkness; he had never had a worse first 
week of term at Hogwarts. 

Page | 348Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




At five o’clock that evening he knocked on Professor 
Umbridge’s office door for what he sincerely hoped 
would be the final time, was told to enter and did so. 
The blank parchment lay ready for him on the lace- 
covered table, the pointed black quill beside it. 

“You know what to do, Mr. Potter,” said Umbridge, 
smiling sweetly over at him. 

Harry picked up the quill and glanced through the 
window. If he just shifted his chair an inch or so to 
the right . . . On the pretext of shifting himself closer to 
the table he managed it. He now had a distant view of 
the Gryffindor Quidditch team soaring up and down 
the pitch, while half a dozen black figures stood at the 
foot of the three high goalposts, apparently awaiting 
their turn to Keep. It was impossible to tell which one 
was Ron at this distance. 

I must not tell lies, Harry wrote. The cut in the back of 
his right hand opened and began to bleed afresh. 

I must not tell lies. The cut dug deeper, stinging and 
smarting. 

I must not tell lies. Blood trickled down his wrist. 

He chanced another glance out of the window. 
Whoever was defending the goalposts now was doing 
a very poor job indeed. Katie Bell scored twice in the 
few seconds Harry dared watch. Hoping very much 
that the Keeper wasn’t Ron, he dropped his eyes back 
to the parchment dotted with blood. 

I must not tell lies. 

I must not tell lies. 



Page | 349Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




He looked up whenever he thought he could risk it, 
when he could hear the scratching of Umbridge’s quill 
or the opening of a desk drawer. The third person to 
try out was pretty good, the fourth was terrible, the 
fifth dodged a Bludger exceptionally well but then 
fumbled an easy save. The sky was darkening so that 
Harry doubted he would be able to watch the sixth 
and seventh people at all. 

I must not tell lies. 

I must not tell lies. 

The parchment was now shining with drops of blood 
from the back of his hand, which was searing with 
pain. When he next looked up, night had fallen and 
the Quidditch pitch was no longer visible. 

“Let’s see if you’ve gotten the message yet, shall we?” 
said Umbridge’s soft voice half an hour later. 

She moved toward him, stretching out her short be- 
ringed fingers for his arm. And then, as she took hold 
of him to examine the words now cut into his skin, 
pain seared, not across the back of his hand, but 
across the scar on his forehead. At the same time, he 
had a most peculiar sensation somewhere around his 
midriff. 

He wrenched his arm out of her grip and leapt to his 
feet, staring at her. She looked back at him, a smile 
stretching her wide, slack mouth. 

“Yes, it hurts, doesn’t it?” she said softly. 

He did not answer. His heart was thumping very hard 
and fast. Was she talking about his hand or did she 
know what he had just felt in his forehead? 



Page | 350Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Well, I think I’ve made my point, Mr. Potter. You may 
go.” 

He caught up his schoolbag and left the room as 
quickly as he could. 

Stay calm, he told himself as he sprinted up the 
stairs. Stay calm, it doesn’t necessarily mean what 
you think it means... 

“ Mimbulus mimbletoniaV ’ he gasped at the Fat Lady, 
who swung forward once more. 

A roar of sound greeted him. Ron came running 
toward him, beaming all over his face and slopping 
butterbeer down his front from the goblet he was 
clutching. 

“Harry, I did it, I’m in, I’m Keeper!” 

“What? Oh — brilliant!” said Harry, trying to smile 
naturally, while his heart continued to race and his 
hand throbbed and bled. 

“Have a butterbeer.” Ron pressed a bottle onto him. “I 
can’t believe it — where’s Hermione gone?” 

“She’s there,” said Fred, who was also swigging 
butterbeer, and pointed to an armchair by the fire. 
Hermione was dozing in it, her drink tipping 
precariously in her hand. 

“Well, she said she was pleased when I told her,” said 
Ron, looking slightly put out. 

“Let her sleep,” said George hastily. It was a few 
moments before Harry noticed that several of the first 
years gathered around them bore unmistakable signs 
of recent nosebleeds. 

Page | 351Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Come here, Ron, and see if Oliver’s old robes fit you,” 
called Katie Bell. “We can take off his name and put 
yours on instead...” 

As Ron moved away, Angelina came striding up to 
Harry. 

“Sorry I was a bit short with you earlier, Potter,” she 
said abruptly. “It’s stressful, this managing lark, you 
know, I’m starting to think I was a bit hard on Wood 
sometimes.” She was watching Ron over the rim of 
her goblet with a slight frown on her face. 

“Look, I know he’s your best mate, but he’s not 
fabulous,” she said bluntly. “I think with a bit of 
training he’ll be all right, though. He comes from a 
family of good Quidditch players. I’m banking on him 
turning out to have a bit more talent than he showed 
today, to be honest. Vicky Frobisher and Geoffrey 
Hooper both flew better this evening, but Hooper’s a 
real whiner, he’s always moaning about something or 
other, and Vicky’s involved in all sorts of societies, 
she admitted herself that if training clashed with her 
Charm Club she’d put Charms first. Anyway, we’re 
having a practice session at two o’clock tomorrow, so 
just make sure you’re there this time. And do me a 
favor and help Ron as much as you can, okay?” 

He nodded and Angelina strolled back to Alicia 
Spinnet. Harry moved over to sit next to Hermione, 
who awoke with a jerk as he put down his bag. 

“Oh, Harry, it’s you... Good about Ron, isn’t it?” she 
said blearily. “I’m just so — so — so tired,” she 
yawned. “I was up until one o’clock making more 
hats. They’re disappearing like mad!” 



Page | 352Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




And sure enough, now that he looked, Harry saw that 
there were woolly hats concealed all around the room 
where unwary elves might accidentally pick them up. 

“Great,” said Harry distractedly; if he did not tell 
somebody soon, he would burst. “Listen, Hermione, I 
was just up in Umbridge’s office and she touched my 
arm ...” 

Hermione listened closely. When Harry had finished 
she said slowly, “You’re worried that You-Know- Who’s 
controlling her like he controlled Quirrell?” 

“Well,” said Harry, dropping his voice, “it’s a 
possibility, isn’t it?” 

“I suppose so,” said Hermione, though she sounded 
unconvinced. “But I don’t think he can be possessing 
her the way he possessed Quirrell, I mean, he’s 
properly alive again now, isn’t he, he’s got his own 
body, he wouldn’t need to share someone else’s. He 
could have her under the Imperius Curse, I 
suppose...” 

Harry watched Fred, George, and Lee Jordan juggling 
empty butterbeer bottles for a moment. Then 
Hermione said, “But last year your scar hurt when 
nobody was touching you, and didn’t Dumbledore say 
it had to do with what You- Know- Who was feeling at 
the time? I mean, maybe this hasn’t got anything to 
do with Umbridge at all, maybe it’s just coincidence it 
happened while you were with her?” 

“She’s evil,” said Harry flatly. “Twisted.” 

“She’s horrible, yes, but ... Harry, I think you ought to 
tell Dumbledore your scar hurt.” 



Page | 353Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




It was the second time in two days he had been 
advised to go to Dumbledore and his answer to 
Hermione was just the same as his answer to Ron. 

“I’m not bothering him with this. Like you just said, 
it’s not a big deal. It’s been hurting on and off all 
summer — it was just a bit worse tonight, that’s all — 



“Harry, I’m sure Dumbledore would want to be 
bothered by this — ” 

“Yeah,” said Harry, before he could stop himself, 
“that’s the only bit of me Dumbledore cares about, 
isn’t it, my scar?” 

“Don’t say that, it’s not true!” 

“I think I’ll write and tell Sirius about it, see what he 
thinks — ” 

“Harry, you can’t put something like that in a letter!” 
said Hermione, looking alarmed. “Don’t you 
remember, Moody told us to be careful what we put in 
writing! We just can’t guarantee owls aren’t being 
intercepted anymore!” 

“All right, all right, I won’t tell him, then!” said Harry 
irritably. He got to his feet. “I’m going to bed. Tell Ron 
for me, will you?” 

“Oh no,” said Hermione, looking relieved, “if you’re 
going that means I can go without being rude too, I’m 
absolutely exhausted and I want to make some more 
hats tomorrow. Listen, you can help me if you like, 
it’s quite fun, I’m getting better, I can do patterns and 
bobbles and all sorts of things now.” 



Page | 354Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Harry looked into her face, which was shining with 
glee, and tried to look as though he was vaguely 
tempted by this offer. 

“Er ... no, I don’t think I will, thanks,” he said. “Er — 
not tomorrow. I’ve got loads of homework to do...” 

And he traipsed off to the boys’ stairs, leaving her 
looking slightly disappointed behind him. 



Page | 355Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 






PERCY AND PADFOOT 

Harry was the first to awake in his dormitory next 
morning. He lay for a moment watching dust swirl in 
the chink of sunlight falling through the gap in his 
four-poster’s hangings and savored the thought that 
it was Saturday. The first week of term seemed to 
have dragged on forever, like one gigantic History of 
Magic lesson. 

Judging by the sleepy silence and the freshly minted 
look of that beam of sunlight, it was just after 
daybreak. He pulled open the curtains around his 
bed, got up, and started to dress. The only sound 
apart from the distant twittering of birds was the 
slow, deep breathing of his fellow Gryffindors. He 
opened his schoolbag carefully, pulled out parchment 
and quill, and headed out of the dormitory for the 
common room. 

Making straight for his favorite squashy old armchair 
beside the now extinct fire, Harry settled himself 
down comfortably and unrolled his parchment while 
looking around the room. The detritus of crumpled-up 

Page | 356Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 



bits of parchment, old Gobstones, empty ingredient 
jars, and candy wrappers that usually covered the 
common room at the end of each day was gone, as 
were all Hermione’s elf hats. Wondering vaguely how 
many elves had now been set free whether they 
wanted to be or not, Harry uncorked his ink bottle, 
dipped his quill into it, and then held it suspended an 
inch above the smooth yellowish surface of his 
parchment, thinking hard... But after a minute or so 
he found himself staring into the empty grate, at a 
complete loss for what to say. 

He could now appreciate how hard it had been for 
Ron and Hermione to write him letters over the 
summer. How was he supposed to tell Sirius 
everything that had happened over the past week and 
pose all the questions he was burning to ask without 
giving potential letter-thieves a lot of information he 
did not want them to have? 

He sat quite motionless for a while, gazing into the 
fireplace, then, finally coming to a decision, he dipped 
his quill into the ink bottle once more and set it 
resolutely upon the parchment. 

Dear Snuffles, 

Hope you’re okay, the first week back here’s been 
terrible, I’m really glad it’s the weekend. 

We’ve got a new Defense Against the Dark Arts 
teacher, Professor Umbridge. She’s nearly as nice as 
your mum. I’m writing because that thing I wrote to 
you about last summer happened again last night 
when I was doing a detention with Umbridge. 

We’re all missing our biggest friend, we hope he’ll be 
back soon. 



Page | 357Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Please write back quickly. 

Best, 

Harry 

Harry reread this letter several times, trying to see it 
from the point of view of an outsider. He could not see 
how they would know what he was talking about — or 
who he was talking to — just from reading this letter. 
He did hope Sirius would pick up the hint about 
Hagrid and tell them when he might be back: Harry 
did not want to ask directly in case it drew too much 
attention to what Hagrid might be up to while he was 
not at Hogwarts. 

Considering it was a very short letter it had taken a 
long time to write; sunlight had crept halfway across 
the room while he had been working on it, and he 
could now hear distant sounds of movement from the 
dormitories above. Sealing the parchment carefully he 
climbed through the portrait hole and headed off for 
the Owlery. 

“I would not go that way if I were you,” said Nearly 
Headless Nick, drifting disconcertingly through a wall 
just ahead of him as he walked down the passage. 
“Peeves is planning an amusing joke on the next 
person to pass the bust of Paracelsus halfway down 
the corridor.” 

“Does it involve Paracelsus falling on top of the 
person’s head?” asked Harry. 

“Funnily enough, it does,” said Nearly Headless Nick 
in a bored voice. “Subtlety has never been Peeves ’s 
strong point. I’m off to try and find the Bloody 
Baron... He might be able to put a stop to it... See 
you, Harry...” 

Page | 358Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Yeah, ’bye,” said Harry and instead of turning right, 
he turned left, taking a longer but safer route up to 
the Owlery. His spirits rose as he walked past window 
after window showing brilliantly blue sky; he had 
training later, he would be back on the Quidditch 
pitch at last — 

Something brushed his ankles. He looked down and 
saw the caretaker’s skeletal gray cat, Mrs. Norris, 
slinking past him. She turned lamplike yellow eyes 
upon him for a moment before disappearing behind a 
statue of Wilfred the Wistful. 

“I’m not doing anything wrong,” Harry called after 
her. She had the unmistakable air of a cat that was 
off to report to her boss, yet Harry could not see why; 
he was perfectly entitled to walk up to the Owlery on 
a Saturday morning. 

The sun was high in the sky now and when Harry 
entered the Owlery the glassless windows dazzled his 
eyes; thick silvery beams of sunlight crisscrossed the 
circular room in which hundreds of owls nestled on 
rafters, a little restless in the early morning light, 
some clearly just returned from hunting. The straw- 
covered floor crunched a little as he stepped across 
tiny animal bones, craning his neck for a sight of 
Hedwig. 

“There you are,” he said, spotting her somewhere near 
the very top of the vaulted ceiling. “Get down here, 

I’ve got a letter for you.” 

With a low hoot she stretched her great white wings 
and soared down onto his shoulder. 

“Right, I know this says ‘Snuffles’ on the outside,” he 
told her, giving her the letter to clasp in her beak and, 



Page | 359Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




without knowing exactly why, whispering, “but it’s for 
Sirius, okay?” 

She blinked her amber eyes once and he took that to 
mean that she understood. 

“Safe flight, then,” said Harry and he carried her to 
one of the windows; with a moment’s pressure on his 
arm Hedwig took off into the blindingly bright sky. He 
watched her until she became a tiny black speck and 
vanished, then switched his gaze to Hagrid’s hut, 
clearly visible from this window, and just as clearly 
uninhabited, the chimney smokeless, the curtains 
drawn. 

The treetops of the Forbidden Forest swayed in a light 
breeze. Harry watched them, savoring the fresh air on 
his face, thinking about Quidditch later ... and then 
he saw it. A great, reptilian winged horse, just like the 
ones pulling the Hogwarts carriages, with leathery 
black wings spread wide like a pterodactyl’s, rose up 
out of the trees like a grotesque, giant bird. It soared 
in a great circle and then plunged once more into the 
trees. The whole thing had happened so quickly Harry 
could hardly believe what he had seen, except that 
his heart was hammering madly. 

The Owlery door opened behind him. He leapt in 
shock, and turning quickly, saw Cho Chang holding a 
letter and a parcel in her hands. 

“Hi,” said Harry automatically. 

“Oh ... hi,” she said breathlessly. “I didn’t think 
anyone would be up here this early. . . I only 
remembered five minutes ago, it’s my mum’s 
birthday.” 



She held up the parcel. 

Page | 360Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Right,” said Harry. His brain seemed to have 
jammed. He wanted to say something funny and 
interesting, but the memory of that terrible winged 
horse was fresh in his mind. 

“Nice day,” he said, gesturing to the windows. His 
insides seemed to shrivel with embarrassment. The 
weather. He was talking about the weather... 

“Yeah,” said Cho, looking around for a suitable owl. 
“Good Quidditch conditions. I haven’t been out all 
week, have you?” 

“No,” said Harry. 

Cho had selected one of the school barn owls. She 
coaxed it down onto her arm where it held out an 
obliging leg so that she could attach the parcel. 

“Hey, has Gryffindor got a new Keeper yet?” she 
asked. 

“Yeah,” said Harry. “It’s my friend Ron Weasley, d’you 
know him?” 

“The Tornado-hater?” said Cho rather coolly. “Is he 
any good?” 

“Yeah,” said Harry, “I think so. I didn’t see his tryout, 
though, I was in detention.” 

Cho looked up, the parcel only half-attached to the 
owl’s legs. 

“That Umbridge woman’s foul,” she said in a low 
voice. “Putting you in detention just because you told 
the truth about how — how — how he died. Everyone 
heard about it, it was all over the school. You were 
really brave standing up to her like that.” 

Page | 361Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Harry’s insides reinflated so rapidly he felt as though 
he might actually float a few inches off the dropping- 
strewn floor. Who cared about a stupid flying horse, 
Cho thought he had been really brave... For a 
moment he considered accidentally-on-purpose 
showing her his cut hand as he helped her tie her 
parcel onto her owl... But the very instant that this 
thrilling thought occurred, the Owlery door opened 
again. 

Filch, the caretaker, came wheezing into the room. 
There were purple patches on his sunken, veined 
cheeks, his jowls were aquiver and his thin gray hair 
disheveled; he had obviously run here. Mrs. Norris 
came trotting at his heels, gazing up at the owls 
overhead and mewing hungrily. There was a restless 
shifting of wings from above, and a large brown owl 
snapped his beak in a menacing fashion. 

“Aha!” said Filch, taking a flat-footed step toward 
Harry, his pouchy cheeks trembling with anger. “I’ve 
had a tip-off that you are intending to place a massive 
order for Dungbombs!” 

Harry folded his arms and stared at the caretaker. 

“Who told you I was ordering Dungbombs?” 

Cho was looking from Harry to Filch, also frowning; 
the barn owl on her arm, tired of standing on one leg, 
gave an admonitory hoot but she ignored it. 

“I have my sources,” said Filch in a self-satisfied hiss. 
“Now hand over whatever it is you’re sending.” 

Feeling immensely thankful that he had not dawdled 
in posting off the letter, Harry said, “I can’t, it’s gone.” 

“Gone?” said Filch, his face contorting with rage. 

Page | 362Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Gone,” said Harry calmly. 



Filch opened his mouth furiously, mouthed for a few 
seconds, then raked Harry’s robes with his eyes. “How 
do I know you haven’t got it in your pocket?” 

“Because — ” 

“I saw him send it,” said Cho angrily. 

Filch rounded on her. 

“You saw him — ?” 

“That’s right, I saw him,” she said fiercely. 

There was a moment’s pause in which Filch glared at 
Cho and Cho glared right back, then the caretaker 
turned and shuffled back toward the door. He 
stopped with his hand on the handle and looked back 
at Harry. 

“If I get so much as a whiff of a Dungbomb ...” 

He stumped off down the stairs. Mrs. Norris cast a 
last longing look at the owls and followed him. 

Harry and Cho looked at each other. 

“Thanks,” Harry said. 

“No problem,” said Cho, finally fixing the parcel to the 
barn owl’s other leg, her face slightly pink. “You 
weren’t ordering Dungbombs, were you?” 

“No,” said Harry. 

“I wonder why he thought you were, then?” she said, 
as she carried the owl to the window. 

Page | 363Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Harry shrugged; he was quite as mystified by that as 
she was, though, oddly, it was not bothering him very 
much at the moment. 

They left the Owlery together. At the entrance of a 
corridor that led toward the west wing of the castle, 
Cho said, “I’m going this way. Well, I’ll ... I’ll see you 
around, Harry.” 

“Yeah ... see you.” 

She smiled at him and departed. He walked on, 
feeling quietly elated. He had managed to have an 
entire conversation with her and not embarrassed 
himself once... You were really brave standing up to 
her like that... She had called him brave... She did not 
hate him for being alive... 

Of course, she had preferred Cedric, he knew that... 
Though if he’d only asked her to the ball before Cedric 
had, things might have turned out differently... She 
had seemed sincerely sorry that she had to refuse 
when Harry had asked her. . . 

“Morning,” Harry said brightly to Ron and Hermione, 
joining them at the Gryffindor table in the Great Hall. 

“What are you looking so pleased about?” said Ron, 
eyeing Harry in surprise. 

“Erm ... Quidditch later,” said Harry happily, pulling 
a large platter of bacon and eggs toward him. 

“Oh ... yeah ...” said Ron. He put down the bit of toast 
he was eating and took a large swig of pumpkin juice. 
Then he said, “Listen ... you don’t fancy going out a 
bit earlier with me, do you? Just to — er — give me 
some practice before training? So I can, you know, get 
my eye in a bit ...” 

Page | 364Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Yeah, okay,” said Harry. 



“Look, I don’t think you should,” said Hermione 
seriously, “you’re both really behind on homework as 



it — ” 



But she broke off; the morning post was arriving and, 
as usual, the Daily Prophet was soaring toward her in 
the beak of a screech owl, which landed perilously 
close to the sugar bowl and held out a leg; Hermione 
pushed a Knut into its leather pouch, took the 
newspaper, and scanned the front page critically as 
the owl took off again. 

“Anything interesting?” said Ron; Harry smiled — he 
knew Ron was keen to get her off the subject of 
homework. 

“No,” she sighed, “just some guff about the bass 
player in the Weird Sisters getting married...” 

She opened the paper and disappeared behind it. 
Harry devoted himself to another helping of eggs and 
bacon; Ron was staring up at the high windows, 
looking slightly preoccupied. 

“Wait a moment,” said Hermione suddenly. “Oh no ... 
Sirius!” 

“What’s happened?” said Harry, and he snatched at 
the paper so violently that it ripped down the middle 
so that he and Hermione were holding half each. 

“ ‘The Ministry of Magic has received a tip-off from a 
reliable source that Sirius Black, notorious mass 
murderer . . . blah blah blah ...is currently hiding in 
London\ ’ ” Hermione read from her half in an 
anguished whisper. 



Page | 365Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Lucius Malfoy, I’ll bet anything,” said Harry in a low, 
furious voice. “He did recognize Sirius on the 
platform...” 

“What?” said Ron, looking alarmed. “You didn’t say — 



“Shh!” said the other two. 

"... ‘Ministry warns Wizarding community that Black is 
very dangerous . . . killed thirteen people . . . broke out of 
Azkaban ...’ the usual rubbish,” Hermione concluded, 
laying down her half of the paper and looking fearfully 
at Harry and Ron. “Well, he just won’t be able to leave 
the house again, that’s all,” she whispered. 
“Dumbledore did warn him not to.” 

Harry looked down glumly at the bit of the Prophet he 
had torn off. Most of the page was devoted to an 
advertisement for Madame Malkin’s Robes for All 
Occasions, which was apparently having a sale. 

“Hey!” he said, flattening it down so Hermione and 
Ron could both see it. “Look at this!” 

“I’ve got all the robes I want,” said Ron. 

“No,” said Harry, “look ... this little piece here ...” 

Ron and Hermione bent closer to read it; the item was 
barely an inch long and placed right at the bottom of 
a column. It was headlined: 

TRESPASS AT MINISTRY 

Sturgis Podmore, 38, of number two, Laburnum 
Gardens, Clapham, has appeared in front of the 
Wizengamot charged with trespass and attempted 
robbery at the Ministry of Magic on 31st August. 

Page | 366Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Podmore was arrested by Ministry of Magic watch- 
wizard Eric Munch, who found him attempting to 
force his way through a top-security door at one 
o’clock in the morning. Podmore, who refused to 
speak in his own defense, was convicted on both 
charges and sentenced to six months in Azkaban. 

“Sturgis Podmore?” said Ron slowly, “but he’s that 
bloke who looks like his head’s been thatched, isn’t 
he? He’s one of the Ord — ” 

“Ron, shh\” said Hermione, casting a terrified look 
around them. 

“Six months in Azkaban!” whispered Harry, shocked. 
“Just for trying to get through a door!” 

“Don’t be silly, it wasn’t just for trying to get through 
a door — what on earth was he doing at the Ministry 
of Magic at one o’clock in the morning?” breathed 
Hermione. 

“D’you reckon he was doing something for the Order?” 
Ron muttered. 

“Wait a moment...” said Harry slowly. “Sturgis was 
supposed to come and see us off, remember?” 

The other two looked at him. 

“Yeah, he was supposed to be part of our guard going 
to King’s Cross, remember? And Moody was all 
annoyed because he didn’t turn up, so that doesn’t 
seem like he was supposed to be on a iob for them, 
does it?” 

“Well, maybe they didn’t expect him to get caught,” 
said Hermione. 



Page | 367Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“It could be a frame-up!” Ron exclaimed excitedly. “No 
— listen!” he went on, dropping his voice dramatically 
at the threatening look on Hermione’s face. “The 
Ministry suspects he’s one of Dumbledore’s lot so — I 
dunno — they lured him to the Ministry, and he 
wasn’t trying to get through a door at all! Maybe 
they’ve just made something up to get him!” 

There was a pause while Harry and Hermione 
considered this. Harry thought it seemed far-fetched; 
Hermione, on the other hand, looked rather 
impressed and said, “Do you know, I wouldn’t be at 
all surprised if that were true.” 

She folded up her half of the newspaper thoughtfully. 
When Harry laid down his knife and fork she seemed 
to come out of a reverie. 

“Right, well, I think we should tackle that essay for 
Sprout on Self-Fertilizing Shrubs first, and if we’re 
lucky we’ll be able to start McGonagall’s Inanimatus 
Conjurus before lunch...” 

Harry felt a small twinge of guilt at the thought of the 
pile of homework awaiting him upstairs, but the sky 
was a clear, exhilarating blue, and he had not been 
on his Firebolt for a week... 

“I mean, we can do it tonight,” said Ron, as he and 
Harry walked down the sloping lawns toward the 
Quidditch pitch, their broomsticks over their 
shoulders, Hermione’s dire warnings that they would 
fail all their O.W.L.s still ringing in their ears. “And 
we’ve got tomorrow. She gets too worked up about 
work, that’s her trouble...” There was a pause and he 
added, in a slightly more anxious tone, “D’you think 
she meant it when she said we weren’t copying from 
her?” 



Page | 368Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Yeah, I do,” said Harry. “Still, this is important too, 
we’ve got to practice if we want to stay on the 
Quidditch team...” 

“Yeah, that’s right,” said Ron in a heartened tone. 

“And we have got plenty of time to do it all...” 

Harry glanced over to his right as they approached 
the Quidditch pitch, to where the trees of the 
Forbidden Forest were swaying darkly. Nothing flew 
out of them; the sky was empty but for a few distant 
owls fluttering around the Owlery Tower. He had 
enough to worry about; the flying horse wasn’t doing 
him any harm: He pushed it out of his mind. 

They collected balls from the cupboard in the 
changing room and set to work, Ron guarding the 
three tall goalposts, Harry playing Chaser and trying 
to get the Quaffle past Ron. Harry thought Ron was 
pretty good; he blocked three-quarters of the goals 
Harry attempted to put past him and played better 
the longer they practiced. After a couple of hours they 
returned to the school, where they ate lunch, during 
which Hermione made it quite clear that she thought 
they were irresponsible, then returned to the 
Quidditch pitch for the real training session. All their 
teammates but Angelina were already in the changing 
room when they entered. 

“All right, Ron?” said George, winking at him. 

“Yeah,” said Ron, who had become quieter and 
quieter all the way down to the pitch. 

“Ready to show us all up, Ickle Prefect?” said Fred, 
emerging tousle-haired from the neck of his Quidditch 
robes, a slightly malicious grin on his face. 



Page | 369Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Shut up,” said Ron, stony-faced, pulling on his own 
team robes for the first time. They fitted him well 
considering they had been Oliver Wood’s, who was 
rather broader in the shoulder. 

“Okay everyone,” said Angelina, entering from the 
Captain’s office, already changed. “Let’s get to it; 

Alicia and Fred, if you can just bring the ball crate 
out for us. Oh, and there are a couple of people out 
there watching but I want you to just ignore them, all 
right?” 

Something in her would-be casual voice made Harry 
think he might know who the uninvited spectators 
were, and sure enough, when they left the changing 
room for the bright sunlight of the pitch it was to a 
storm of catcalls and jeers from the Slytherin 
Quidditch team and assorted hangers-on, who were 
grouped halfway up the empty stands and whose 
voices echoed loudly around the stadium. 

“What’s that Weasley’s riding?” Malfoy called in his 
sneering drawl. “Why would anyone put a Flying 
Charm on a moldy old log like that?” 

Crabbe, Goyle, and Pansy Parkinson guffawed and 
shrieked with laughter. Ron mounted his broom and 
kicked off from the ground and Harry followed him, 
watching his ears turn red from behind. 

“Ignore them,” he said, accelerating to catch up with 
Ron. “We’ll see who’s laughing after we play them...” 

“Exactly the attitude I want, Harry,” said Angelina 
approvingly, soaring around them with the Quaffle 
under her arm and slowing to hover on the spot in 
front of her airborne team. “Okay everyone, we’re 
going to start with some passes just to warm up, the 
whole team please — ” 

Page | 370Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Hey, Johnson, what’s with that hairstyle anyway?” 
shrieked Pansy Parkinson from below. “Why would 
anyone want to look like they’ve got worms coming 
out of their head?” 

Angelina swept her long braided hair out of her face 
and said calmly, “Spread out, then, and let’s see what 
we can do...” 

Harry reversed away from the others to the far side of 
the pitch. Ron fell back toward the opposite goal. 
Angelina raised the Quaffle with one hand and threw 
it hard to Fred, who passed to George, who passed to 
Harry, who passed to Ron, who dropped it. 

The Slytherins, led by Malfoy, roared and screamed 
with laughter. Ron, who had pelted toward the 
ground to catch the Quaffle before it landed, pulled 
out of the dive untidily, so that he slipped sideways 
on his broom, and returned to playing height, 
blushing. Harry saw Fred and George exchange looks, 
but uncharacteristically neither of them said 
anything, for which he was grateful. 

“Pass it on, Ron,” called Angelina, as though nothing 
had happened. 

Ron threw the Quaffle to Alicia, who passed back to 
Harry, who passed to George... 

“Hey, Potter, how’s your scar feeling?” called Malfoy. 
“Sure you don’t need a lie-down? It must be, what, a 
whole week since you were in the hospital wing, that’s 
a record for you, isn’t it?” 

Fred passed to Angelina; she reverse passed to Harry, 
who had not been expecting it, but caught it in the 
very tips of his fingers and passed it quickly to Ron, 
who lunged for it and missed by inches.

“Come on now, Ron,” said Angelina crossly, as Ron 
dived for the ground again, chasing the Quaffle. “Pay 
attention.” 

It would have been hard to say whether Ron’s face or 
the Quaffle was a deeper scarlet when he returned 
again to playing height. Malfoy and the rest of the 
Slytherin team were howling with laughter. 

On his third attempt, Ron caught the Quaffle; 
perhaps out of relief he passed it on so 
enthusiastically that it soared straight through Katie’s 
outstretched hands and hit her hard in the face. 

“Sorry!” Ron groaned, zooming forward to see whether 
he had done any damage. 

“Get back in position, she’s fine!” barked Angelina. 
“But as you’re passing to a teammate, do try not to 
knock her off her broom, won’t you? We’ve got 
Bludgers for that!” 

Katie’s nose was bleeding. Down below the Slytherins 
were stamping their feet and jeering. Fred and George 
converged on Katie. 

“Here, take this,” Fred told her, handing her 
something small and purple from out of his pocket. 
“It’ll clear it up in no time.” 

“All right,” called Angelina, “Fred, George, go and get 
your bats and a Bludger; Ron, get up to the goalposts, 
Harry, release the Snitch when I say so. We’re going 
to aim for Ron’s goal, obviously.” 

Harry zoomed off after the twins to fetch the Snitch. 

“Ron’s making a right pig’s ear of things, isn’t he?” 
muttered George, as the three of them landed at the 

Page | 372Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




crate containing the balls and opened it to extract one 
of the Bludgers and the Snitch. 

“He’s just nervous,” said Harry. “He was fine when I 
was practicing with him this morning.” 

“Yeah, well, I hope he hasn’t peaked too soon,” said 
Fred gloomily. 

They returned to the air. When Angelina blew her 
whistle, Harry released the Snitch and Fred and 
George let fly the Bludger; from that moment on, 

Harry was barely aware of what the others were 
doing. It was his job to recapture the tiny fluttering 
golden ball that was worth a hundred and fifty points 
to the Seeker’s team and doing so required enormous 
speed and skill. He accelerated, rolling and swerving 
in and out of the Chasers, the warm autumn air 
whipping his face and the distant yells of the 
Slytherins so much meaningless roaring in his ears... 
But too soon, the whistle brought him to a halt again. 

“Stop — stop - STOP!” screamed Angelina. “Ron — 
you’re not covering your middle post!” 

Harry looked around at Ron, who was hovering in 
front of the left-hand hoop, leaving the other two 
completely unprotected. 

“Oh ... sorry ...” 

“You keep shifting around while you’re watching the 
Chasers!” said Angelina. “Either stay in center 
position until you have to move to defend a hoop, or 
else circle the hoops, but don’t drift vaguely off to one 
side, that’s how you let in the last three goals!” 

“Sorry ...” Ron repeated, his red face shining like a 
beacon against the bright blue sky. 

Page | 373Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“And Katie, can’t you do something about that 
nosebleed?” 

“It’s just getting worse!” said Katie thickly, attempting 
to stem the flow with her sleeve. 

Harry glanced around at Fred, who was looking 
anxious and checking his pockets. He saw Fred pull 
out something purple, examine it for a second, and 
then look around at Katie, evidently horrorstruck. 

“Well, let’s try again,” said Angelina. She was ignoring 
the Slytherins, who had now set up a chant of 
“ Gryffindor are losers, Gryffindor are losers,” but there 
was a certain rigidity about her seat on the broom 
nevertheless. 

This time they had been flying for barely three 
minutes when Angelina’s whistle sounded. Harry, 
who had just sighted the Snitch circling the opposite 
goalpost, pulled up feeling distinctly aggrieved. 

“What now?” he said impatiently to Alicia, who was 
nearest. 

“Katie,” she said shortly. 

Harry turned and saw Angelina, Fred, and George all 
flying as fast as they could toward Katie. Harry and 
Alicia sped toward her too. It was plain that Angelina 
had stopped training just in time; Katie was now 
chalk- white and covered in blood. 

“She needs the hospital wing,” said Angelina. 

“We’ll take her,” said Fred. “She — er — might have 
swallowed a Blood Blisterpod by mistake — ” 



Page | 374Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Well, there’s no point continuing with no Beaters and 
a Chaser gone,” said Angelina glumly, as Fred and 
George zoomed off toward the castle supporting Katie 
between them. “Come on, let’s go and get changed.” 

The Slytherins continued to chant as they trailed 
back into the changing rooms. 

“How was practice?” asked Hermione rather coolly 
half an hour later, as Harry and Ron climbed through 
the portrait hole into the Gryffindor common room. 

“It was — ” Harry began. 

“Completely lousy,” said Ron in a hollow voice, 
sinking into a chair beside Hermione. She looked up 
at Ron and her frostiness seemed to melt. 

“Well, it was only your first one,” she said consolingly, 
“it’s bound to take time to — ” 

“Who said it was me who made it lousy?” snapped 
Ron. 

“No one,” said Hermione, looking taken aback, “I 
thought — ” 

“You thought I was bound to be rubbish?” 

“No, of course I didn’t! Look, you said it was lousy so I 
just — ” 

“I’m going to get started on some homework,” said 
Ron angrily and stomped off to the staircase to the 
boys’ dormitories and vanished from sight. Hermione 
turned to Harry. 

“ Was he lousy?” 



Page | 375Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“No,” said Harry loyally. 

Hermione raised her eyebrows. 

“Well, I suppose he could’ve played better,” Harry 
muttered, “but it was only the first training session, 
like you said...” 

Neither Harry nor Ron seemed to make much 
headway with their homework that night. Harry knew 
Ron was too preoccupied with how badly he had 
performed at Quidditch practice and he himself was 
having difficulty in getting the chant of “Gryffindor are 
losers” out of his head. 

They spent the whole of Sunday in the common room, 
buried in their books while the room around them 
filled up, then emptied: It was another clear, fine day 
and most of their fellow Gryffindors spent the day out 
in the grounds, enjoying what might well be some of 
the last sunshine that year. By the evening Harry felt 
as though somebody had been beating his brain 
against the inside of his skull. 

“You know, we probably should try and get more 
homework done during the week,” Harry muttered to 
Ron, as they finally laid aside Professor McGonagall’s 
long essay on the Inanimatus Conjurus spell and 
turned miserably to Professor Sinistra ’s equally long 
and difficult essay about Jupiter’s moons. 

“Yeah,” said Ron, rubbing slightly bloodshot eyes and 
throwing his fifth spoiled bit of parchment into the 
fire beside them. “Listen ... shall we just ask 
Hermione if we can have a look at what she’s done?” 

Harry glanced over at her; she was sitting with 
Crookshanks on her lap and chatting merrily to 
Ginny as a pair of knitting needles flashed in midair 

Page | 376Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




in front of her, now knitting a pair of shapeless elf 
socks. 



“No,” he said heavily, “you know she won’t let us.” 

And so they worked on while the sky outside the 
windows became steadily darker; slowly, the crowd in 
the common room began to thin again. At half-past 
eleven, Hermione wandered over to them, yawning. 

“Nearly done?” 

“No,” said Ron shortly. 

“Jupiter’s biggest moon is Ganymede, not Callisto,” 
she said, pointing over Ron’s shoulder at a line in his 
Astronomy essay, “and it’s Io that’s got the volcanos.” 

“Thanks,” snarled Ron, scratching out the offending 
sentences. 

“Sorry, I only — ” 

“Yeah, well, if you’ve just come over here to criticize — 



“Ron — ” 

“I haven’t got time to listen to a sermon, all right, 
Hermione, I’m up to my neck in it here — ” 

“No — look!” 

Hermione was pointing to the nearest window. Harry 
and Ron both looked over. A handsome screech owl 
was standing on the windowsill, gazing into the room 
at Ron. 



Page | 377Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Isn’t that Hermes?” said Hermione, sounding 
amazed. 

“Blimey, it is!” said Ron quietly, throwing down his 
quill and getting to his feet. “What’s Percy writing to 
me for?” 

He crossed to the window and opened it; Hermes flew 
inside, landed upon Ron’s essay, and held out a leg to 
which a letter was attached. Ron took it off and the 
owl departed at once, leaving inky footprints across 
Ron’s drawing of the moon Io. 

“That’s definitely Percy’s handwriting,” said Ron, 
sinking back into his chair and staring at the words 
on the outside of the scroll: To Ronald Weasley, 
Gryffindor House, Hogwarts. He looked up at the 
other two. “What d’you reckon?” 

“Open it!” said Hermione eagerly. Harry nodded. 

Ron unrolled the scroll and began to read. The farther 
down the parchment his eyes traveled, the more 
pronounced became his scowl. When he had finished 
reading, he looked disgusted. He thrust the letter at 
Harry and Hermione, who leaned toward each other 
to read it together: 

Dear Ron, 

I have only just heard (from no less a person than the 
Minister of Magic himself, who has it from your new 
teacher, Professor Umbridge) that you have become a 
Hogwarts prefect 

I was most pleasantly surprised when I heard this 
news and must firstly offer my congratulations. I must 
admit that I have always been afraid that you would 
take what we might call the “Fred and George ” route, 

Page | 378Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




rather than following in my footsteps, so you can 
imagine my feelings on hearing you have stopped 
flouting authority and have decided to shoulder some 
real responsibility. 

But I want to give you more than congratulations, Ron, 

I want to give you some advice, which is why I am 
sending this at night rather than by the usual morning 
post Hopefully you will be able to read this away from 
prying eyes and avoid awkward questions. 

From something the Minister let slip when telling me 
you are now a prefect, I gather that you are still seeing 
a lot of Harry Potter. I must tell you, Ron, that nothing 
could put you in danger of losing your badge more than 
continued fraternization with that boy. Yes, I am sure 
you are surprised to hear this — no doubt you will say 
that Potter has always been Dumbledore’s favorite — 
but I feel bound to tell you that Dumbledore may not be 
in charge at Hogwarts much longer and the people who 
count have a very different — and probably more 
accurate — view of Potters behavior. I shall say no 
more here, but if you look at the Daily Prophet 
tomorrow you will get a good idea of the way the wind 
is blowing — and see if you can spot yours truly! 

Seriously, Ron, you do not want to be tarred with the 
same brush as Potter, it could be very damaging to 
your future prospects, and I am talking here about life 
after school too. As you must be aware, given that our 
father escorted him to court, Potter had a disciplinary 
hearing this summer in front of the whole Wizengamot 
and he did not come out of it looking too good. He got 
off on a mere technicality if you ask me and many of 
the people I’ve spoken to remain convinced of his guilt. 

It may be that you are afraid to sever ties with Potter 
— I know that he can be unbalanced and, for all I 
know, violent — but if you have any worries about this, 

Page | 379Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




or have spotted anything else in Potter’s behavior that 
is troubling you, I urge you to speak to Dolores 
Umbridge, a really delightful woman, who I know will 
be only too happy to advise you. 

This leads me to my other bit of advice. As I have 
hinted above, Dumbledore’s regime at Hog warts may 
soon be over. Your loyalty, Ron, should be not to him, 
but to the school and the Ministry. I am very sorry to 
hear that so far Professor Umbridge is encountering 
very little cooperation from staff as she strives to make 
those necessary changes within Hogwarts that the 
Ministry so ardently desires (although she should find 
this easier from next week — again, see the Prophet 
tomorrow!). I shall say only this — a student who 
shows himself willing to help Professor Umbridge now 
may be very well placed for Head Boy ship in a couple 
of years! 

I am sorry that I was unable to see more of you over 
the summer. It pains me to criticize our parents, but I 
am afraid I can no longer live under their roof while 
they remain mixed up with the dangerous crowd 
around Dumbledore (if you are writing to Mother at any 
point, you might tell her that a certain Sturgis Podmore, 
who is a great friend of Dumbledore’s, has recently 
been sent to Azkaban for trespass at the Ministry. 
Perhaps that will open their eyes to the kind of petty 
criminals with whom they are currently rubbing 
shoulders). I count myself very lucky to have escaped 
the stigma of association with such people — the 
Minister really could not be more gracious to me — and 
I do hope, Ron, that you will not allow family ties to 
blind you to the misguided nature of our parents’ 
beliefs and actions either. I sincerely hope that, in time, 
they will realize how mistaken they were and I shall, 
of course, be ready to accept a full apology when that 
day comes. 



Page | 380Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Please think over what I have said most carefully, 
particularly the bit about Harry Potter, and 
congratulations again on becoming prefect. 

Your brother, 

Percy 

Harry looked up at Ron. 

“Well,” he said, trying to sound as though he found 
the whole thing a joke, “if you want to — er — what is 
it?” (He checked Percy’s letter.) “Oh yeah — ‘sever ties’ 
with me, I swear I won’t get violent.” 

“Give it back,” said Ron, holding out his hand. “He is 
— ” Ron said jerkily, tearing Percy’s letter in half, “the 
world’s” — he tore it into quarters — “biggest” — he 
tore it into eighths — “git.” He threw the pieces into 
the fire. 

“Come on, we’ve got to get this finished some time 
before dawn,” he said briskly to Harry, pulling 
Professor Sinistra ’s essay back toward him. 

Hermione was looking at Ron with an odd expression 
on her face. 

“Oh, give them here,” she said abruptly. 

“What?” said Ron. 

“Give them to me, I’ll look through them and correct 
them,” she said. 

“Are you serious? Ah, Hermione, you’re a lifesaver,” 
said Ron, “what can I — ?” 



Page | 381Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“What you can say is, ‘We promise well never leave 
our homework this late again,’ ” she said, holding out 
both hands for their essays, but she looked slightly 
amused all the same. 

“Thanks a million, Hermione,” said Harry weakly, 
passing over his essay and sinking back into his 
armchair, rubbing his eyes. 

It was now past midnight and the common room was 
deserted but for the three of them and Crookshanks. 
The only sound was that of Hermione’s quill 
scratching out sentences here and there on their 
essays and the ruffle of pages as she checked various 
facts in the reference books strewn across the table. 
Harry was exhausted. He also felt an odd, sick, empty 
feeling in his stomach that had nothing to do with 
tiredness and everything to do with the letter now 
curling blackly in the heart of the fire. 

He knew that half the people inside Hogwarts thought 
him strange, even mad; he knew that the Daily 
Prophet had been making snide allusions to him for 
months, but there was something about seeing it 
written down like that in Percy’s writing, about 
knowing that Percy was advising Ron to drop him and 
even to tell tales on him to Umbridge, that made his 
situation real to him as nothing else had. He had 
known Percy for four years, had stayed in his house 
during the summers, shared a tent with him during 
the Quidditch World Cup, had even been awarded full 
marks by him in the second task of the Triwizard 
Tournament last year, yet now, Percy thought him 
unbalanced and possibly violent. 

And with a surge of sympathy for his godfather, Harry 
thought that Sirius was probably the only person he 
knew who could really understand how he felt at the 
moment, because Sirius was in the same situation; 

Page | 382Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




nearly everyone in the Wizarding world thought Sirius 
a dangerous murderer and a great Voldemort 
supporter and he had had to live with that knowledge 
for fourteen years... 

Harry blinked. He had just seen something in the fire 
that could not have been there. It had flashed into 
sight and vanished immediately. No ... it could not 
have been... He had imagined it because he had been 
thinking about Sirius... 

“Okay, write that down,” Hermione said to Ron, 
pushing his essay and a sheet covered in her own 
writing back to Ron, “and then copy out this 
conclusion that I’ve written for you.” 

“Hermione, you are honestly the most wonderful 
person I’ve ever met,” said Ron weakly, “and if I’m 
ever rude to you again — ” 

“ — I’ll know you’re back to normal,” said Hermione. 
“Harry, yours is okay except for this bit at the end, I 
think you must have misheard Professor Sinistra, 
Europa’s covered in ice, not mice — Harry?” 

Harry had slid off his chair onto his knees and was 
now crouching on the singed and threadbare 
hearthrug, gazing into the flames. 

“Er — Harry?” said Ron uncertainly. “Why are you 
down there?” 

“Because I’ve just seen Sirius’s head in the fire,” said 
Harry. 

He spoke quite calmly; after all, he had seen Sirius’s 
head in this very fire the previous year and talked to 
it too. Nevertheless, he could not be sure that he had 
really seen it this time... It had vanished so quickly... 

Page | 383Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Sirius’s head?” Hermione repeated. “You mean like 
when he wanted to talk to you during the Triwizard 
Tournament? But he wouldn’t do that now, it would 
be too — Siriusl” 

She gasped, gazing at the fire; Ron dropped his quill. 
There in the middle of the dancing flames sat Sirius’s 
head, long dark hair falling around his grinning face. 

“I was starting to think you’d go to bed before 
everyone else had disappeared,” he said. “I’ve been 
checking every hour.” 

“You’ve been popping into the fire every hour?” Harry 
said, half laughing. 

“Just for a few seconds to check if the coast was clear 
yet.” 

“But what if you’d been seen?” said Hermione 
anxiously. 

“Well, I think a girl — first year by the look of her — 
might’ve got a glimpse of me earlier, but don’t worry,” 
Sirius said hastily, as Hermione clapped a hand to 
her mouth. “I was gone the moment she looked back 
at me and I’ll bet she just thought I was an oddly 
shaped log or something.” 

“But Sirius, this is taking an awful risk — ” Hermione 
began. 

“You sound like Molly,” said Sirius. “This was the only 
way I could come up with of answering Harry’s letter 
without resorting to a code — and codes are 
breakable.” 

At the mention of Harry’s letter, Hermione and Ron 
had both turned to stare at him. 

Page | 384Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“You didn’t say you’d written to Sirius!” said 
Hermione accusingly. 



“I forgot,” said Harry, which was perfectly true; his 
meeting with Cho in the Owlery had driven everything 
before it out of his mind. “Don’t look at me like that, 
Hermione, there was no way anyone would have got 
secret information out of it, was there, Sirius?” 

“No, it was very good,” said Sirius, smiling. “Anyway, 
we’d better be quick, just in case we’re disturbed — 
your scar.” 

“What about — ?” Ron began, but Hermione said 
quickly, “We’ll tell you afterward, go on, Sirius.” 

“Well, I know it can’t be fun when it hurts, but we 
don’t think it’s anything to really worry about. It kept 
aching all last year, didn’t it?” 

“Yeah, and Dumbledore said it happened whenever 
Voldemort was feeling a powerful emotion,” said 
Harry, ignoring, as usual, Ron and Hermione ’s 
winces. “So maybe he was just, I dunno, really angry 
or something the night I had that detention.” 

“Well, now he’s back it’s bound to hurt more often,” 
said Sirius. 

“So you don’t think it had anything to do with 
Umbridge touching me when I was in detention with 
her?” Harry asked. 

“I doubt it,” said Sirius. “I know her by reputation and 
I’m sure she’s no Death Eater — ” 

“She’s foul enough to be one,” said Harry darkly and 
Ron and Hermione nodded vigorously in agreement. 

Page | 385Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Yes, but the world isn’t split into good people and 
Death Eaters,” said Sirius with a wry smile. “I know 
she’s a nasty piece of work, though — you should 
hear Remus talk about her.” 

“Does Lupin know her?” asked Harry quickly, 
remembering Umbridge’s comments about dangerous 
half-breeds during her first lesson. 

“No,” said Sirius, “but she drafted a bit of anti- 
werewolf legislation two years ago that makes it 
almost impossible for him to get a job.” 

Harry remembered how much shabbier Lupin looked 
these days and his dislike of Umbridge deepened even 
further. 

“What’s she got against werewolves?” said Hermione 
angrily. 

“Scared of them, I expect,” said Sirius, smiling at her 
indignation. “Apparently she loathes part-humans; 
she campaigned to have mer-people rounded up and 
tagged last year too. Imagine wasting your time and 
energy persecuting merpeople when there are little 
toerags like Kreacher on the loose — ” 

Ron laughed but Hermione looked upset. 

“Sirius!” she said reproachfully. “Honestly, if you 
made a bit of an effort with Kreacher I’m sure he’d 
respond, after all, you are the only member of his 
family he’s got left, and Professor Dumbledore said — ” 

“So what are Umbridge’s lessons like?” Sirius 
interrupted. “Is she training you all to kill half- 
breeds?” 



Page | 386Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“No,” said Harry, ignoring Hermione’s affronted look 
at being cut off in her defense of Kreacher. “She’s not 
letting us use magic at all!” 

“All we do is read the stupid textbook,” said Ron. 

“Ah, well, that figures,” said Sirius. “Our information 
from inside the Ministry is that Fudge doesn’t want 
you trained in combat.” 

“ Trained in combat?” repeated Harry incredulously. 
“What does he think we’re doing here, forming some 
sort of wizard army?” 

“That’s exactly what he thinks you’re doing,” said 
Sirius, “or rather, that’s exactly what he’s afraid 
Dumbledore’s doing — forming his own private army, 
with which he will be able to take on the Ministry of 
Magic.” 

There was a pause at this, then Ron said, “That’s the 
stupidest thing I’ve ever heard, including all the stuff 
that Luna Lovegood comes out with.” 

“So we’re being prevented from learning Defense 
Against the Dark Arts because Fudge is scared we’ll 
use spells against the Ministry?” said Hermione, 
looking furious. 

“Yep,” said Sirius. “Fudge thinks Dumbledore will 
stop at nothing to seize power. He’s getting more 
paranoid about Dumbledore by the day. It’s a matter 
of time before he has Dumbledore arrested on some 
trumped-up charge.” 

This reminded Harry of Percy’s letter. 



Page | 387Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“D’you know if there’s going to be anything about 
Dumbledore in the Daily Prophet tomorrow? Only 
Ron’s brother Percy reckons there will be — ” 

“I don’t know,” said Sirius, “I haven’t seen anyone 
from the Order all weekend, they’re all busy. It’s just 
been Kreacher and me here...” 

There was a definite note of bitterness in Sirius’s 
voice. 

“So you haven’t had any news about Hagrid, either?” 

“Ah ...” said Sirius, “well, he was supposed to be back 
by now, no one’s sure what’s happened to him.” Then, 
seeing their stricken faces, he added quickly, “But 
Dumbledore’s not worried, so don’t you three get 
yourselves in a state; I’m sure Hagrid’s fine.” 

“But if he was supposed to be back by now ...” said 
Hermione in a small, worried voice. 

“Madame Maxime was with him, we’ve been in touch 
with her and she says they got separated on the 
journey home — but there’s nothing to suggest he’s 
hurt or — well, nothing to suggest he’s not perfectly 
okay.” 

Unconvinced, Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchanged 
worried looks. 

“Listen, don’t go asking too many questions about 
Hagrid,” said Sirius hastily, “it’ll just draw even more 
attention to the fact that he’s not back, and I know 
Dumbledore doesn’t want that. Hagrid’s tough, he’ll 
be okay.” And when they did not appear cheered by 
this, Sirius added, “When’s your next Hogsmeade 
weekend anyway? I was thinking, we got away with 



Page | 388Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




the dog disguise at the station, didn’t we? I thought I 
could — ” 



“NO!” said Harry and Hermione together, very loudly. 

“Sirius, didn’t you see the Daily Prophet?” said 
Hermione anxiously. 

“Oh that,” said Sirius, grinning, “they’re always 
guessing where I am, they haven’t really got a clue — ” 

“Yeah, but we think this time they have,” said Harry. 
“Something Malfoy said on the train made us think he 
knew it was you, and his father was on the platform, 
Sirius — you know, Lucius Malfoy — so don’t come 
up here, whatever you do, if Malfoy recognizes you 
again — ” 

“All right, all right, I’ve got the point,” said Sirius. He 
looked most displeased. “Just an idea, thought you 
might like to get together — ” 

“I would, I just don’t want you chucked back in 
Azkaban!” said Harry. 

There was a pause in which Sirius looked out of the 
fire at Harry, a crease between his sunken eyes. 

“You’re less like your father than I thought,” he said 
finally, a definite coolness in his voice. “The risk 
would’ve been what made it fun for James.” 

“Look — ” 

“Well, I’d better get going, I can hear Kreacher coming 
down the stairs,” said Sirius, but Harry was sure he 
was lying. “I’ll write to tell you a time I can make it 
back into the fire, then, shall I? If you can stand to 
risk it?” 

Page | 389Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




There was a tiny pop, and the place where Sirius’s 
head had been was flickering flame once more. 



Page | 390Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 






THE HOGWARTS HIGH INQUISITOR 

They had expected to have to comb Hermione’s Daily 
Prophet carefully next morning to find the article 
Percy had mentioned in his letter. However, the 
departing delivery owl had barely cleared the top of 
the milk jug when Hermione let out a huge gasp and 
flattened the newspaper to reveal a large photograph 
of Dolores Umbridge, smiling widely and blinking 
slowly at them from beneath the headline: 

MINISTRY SEEKS EDUCATIONAL REFORM 

DOLORES UMBRIDGE APPOINTED FIRST-EVER 
“HIGH INQUISITOR” 

“ “High Inquisitor’?” said Harry darkly, his half-eaten 
bit of toast slipping from his fingers. “What does that 
mean?” 

Hermione read aloud: 

“In a surprise move last night the Ministry of Magic 
passed new legislation giving itself an unprecedented 

Page | 391Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 



level of control at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and 
Wizardry. 

“ ‘The Minister has been growing uneasy about goings- 
on at Hogwarts for some time,’ said Junior Assistant to 
the Minister, Percy Weasley. ‘He is now responding to 
concerns voiced by anxious parents, who feel the 
school may be moving in a direction they do not 
approve.’ 

“This is not the first time in recent weeks Fudge has 
used new laws to effect improvements at the 
Wizarding school. As recently as August 30th 
Educational Decree Twenty -two was passed, to ensure 
that, in the event of the current headmaster being 
unable to provide a candidate for a teaching post, the 
Ministry should select an appropriate person. 

“ ‘That’s how Dolores Umbridge came to be appointed 
to the teaching staff at Hogwarts,’ said Weasley last 
night. ‘Dumbledore couldn’t find anyone, so the 
Minister put in Umbridge and of course, she’s been an 
immediate success — ’ ” 

“She’s been a WHAT?” said Harry loudly. 

“Wait, there’s more,” said Hermione grimly. 

“ ‘ — an immediate success, totally revolutionizing the 
teaching of Defense Against the Dark Arts and 
providing the Minister with on-the-ground feedback 
about what’s really happening at Hogwarts.’ 

“It is this last function that the Ministry has now 
formalized with the passing of Educational Decree 
Twenty-three, which creates the new position of 
‘Hogwarts High Inquisitor.’ 



Page | 392Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“ ‘This is an exciting new phase in the Minister’s plan 
to get to grips with what some are calling the “falling 
standards” at Hog warts,’ said Weasley. ‘The Inquisitor 
will have powers to inspect her fellow educators and 
make sure that they are coming up to scratch. 

Professor Umbridge has been offered this position in 
addition to her own teaching post, and we are 
delighted to say that she has accepted.’ 

“The Ministry’s new moves have received enthusiastic 
support from parents of students at Hogwarts. 

“ ‘I feel much easier in my mind now that I know that 
Dumbledore is being subjected to fair and objective 
evaluation,’ said Mr. Lucius Malfoy, 41, speaking from 
his Wiltshire mansion last night. ‘Many of us with our 
children’s best interests at heart have been concerned 
about some of Dumbledore’s eccentric decisions in the 
last few years and will be glad to know that the 
Ministry is keeping an eye on the situation.’ 

“Among those ‘eccentric decisions’ are undoubtedly the 
controversial staff appointments previously described 
in this newspaper, which have included the hiring of 
werewolf Remus Lupin, half giant Rubeus Hagrid, and 
delusional ex-Auror ‘Mad-Eye’ Moody. 

“Rumors abound, of course, that Albus Dumbledore, 
once Supreme Mugwump of the International 
Confederation of Wizards and Chief Warlock of the 
Wizengamot, is no longer up to the task of managing 
the prestigious school of Hogwarts. 

“ ‘I think the appointment of the Inquisitor is a first step 
toward ensuring that Hogwarts has a headmaster in 
whom we can all repose confidence,’ said a Ministry 
insider last night. 



Page | 393Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Wizengamot elders Gris elda M archbanks and Tiberius 
Ogden have resigned in protest at the introduction of 
the post of Inquisitor to Hogwarts. 

“ ‘Hogwarts is a school, not an outpost of Cornelius 
Fudge’s office,’ said Madam Marchbanks. ‘This is a 
further disgusting attempt to discredit Albus 
Dumbledore.’ (For a full account of Madam 
Marchbanks’ alleged links to subversive goblin groups, 
turn to page 17].” 

Hermione finished reading and looked across the 
table at the other two. 

“So now we know how we ended up with Umbridge! 
Fudge passed this ‘Educational Decree’ and forced 
her on us! And now he’s given her the power to 
inspect other teachers!” Hermione was breathing fast 
and her eyes were very bright. “I can’t believe this. It’s 
outrageous...” 

“I know it is,” said Harry. He looked down at his right 
hand, clenched upon the tabletop, and saw the faint 
white outline of the words Umbridge had forced him 
to cut into his skin. 

But a grin was unfurling on Ron’s face. 

“What?” said Harry and Hermione together, staring at 
him. 

“Oh, I can’t wait to see McGonagall inspected,” said 
Ron happily. “Umbridge won’t know what’s hit her.” 

“Well, come on,” said Hermione, jumping up, “we’d 
better get going, if she’s inspecting Binns’s class we 
don’t want to be late...” 



Page | 394Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




But Professor Umbridge was not inspecting their 
History of Magic lesson, which was just as dull as the 
previous Monday, nor was she in Snape’s dungeon 
when they arrived for double Potions, where Harry’s 
moonstone essay was handed back to him with a 
large, spiky black D scrawled in an upper corner. 

“I have awarded you the grades you would have 
received if you presented this work in your O.W.L,” 
said Snape with a smirk, as he swept among them, 
passing back their homework. “This should give you a 
realistic idea of what to expect in your examination.” 

Snape reached the front of the class and turned to 
face them. 

“The general standard of this homework was abysmal. 
Most of you would have failed had this been your 
examination. I expect to see a great deal more effort 
for this week’s essay on the various varieties of venom 
antidotes, or I shall have to start handing out 
detentions to those dunces who get D’s.” 

He smirked as Malfoy sniggered and said in a 
carrying whisper, “Some people got D’s? Ha!” 

Harry realized that Hermione was looking sideways to 
see what grade he had received; he slid his 
moonstone essay back into his bag as quickly as 
possible, feeling that he would rather keep that 
information private. 

Determined not to give Snape an excuse to fail him 
this lesson, Harry read and reread every line of the 
instructions on the blackboard at least three times 
before acting on them. His Strengthening Solution 
was not precisely the clear turquoise shade of 
Hermione ’s but it was at least blue rather than pink, 
like Neville’s, and he delivered a flask of it to Snape’s 
Page | 395Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




desk at the end of the lesson with a feeling of mingled 
defiance and relief. 

“Well, that wasn’t as bad as last week, was it?” said 
Hermione, as they climbed the steps out of the 
dungeon and made their way across the entrance hall 
toward lunch. “And the homework didn’t go too badly 
either, did it?” 

When neither Ron nor Harry answered, she pressed 
on, “I mean, all right, I didn’t expect the top grade, 
not if he’s marking to O.W.L. standard, but a pass is 
quite encouraging at this stage, wouldn’t you say?” 

Harry made a noncommittal noise in his throat. 

“Of course, a lot can happen between now and the 
exam, we’ve got plenty of time to improve, but the 
grades we’re getting now are a sort of baseline, aren’t 
they? Something we can build on ...” 

They sat down together at the Gryffindor table. 

“Obviously, I’d have been thrilled if I’d gotten an O — ” 

“Hermione,” said Ron sharply, “if you want to know 
what grades we got, ask.” 

“I don’t — I didn’t mean — well, if you want to tell me 



“I got a P,” said Ron, ladling soup into his bowl. 
“Happy?” 

“Well, that’s nothing to be ashamed of,” said Fred, 
who had just arrived at the table with George and Lee 
Jordan and was sitting down on Harry’s right. 
“Nothing wrong with a good healthy P.” 



Page | 396Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“But,” said Hermione, “doesn’t P stand for ...” 

“ Boor,’ yeah,” said Lee Jordan. “Still, better than D, 
isn’t it? ‘Dreadful’?” 

Harry felt his face grow warm and faked a small 
coughing fit over his roll. When he emerged from this 
he was sorry to find that Hermione was still in full 
flow about O.W.L. grades. 

“So top grade’s O for ‘Outstanding,’ ” she was saying, 
“and then there’s A — ” 

“No, E,” George corrected her, “E for ‘Exceeds 
Expectations.’ And I’ve always thought Fred and I 
should’ve got E in everything, because we exceeded 
expectations just by turning up for the exams.” 

They all laughed except Hermione, who plowed on, 

“So after E, it’s A for ‘Acceptable,’ and that’s the last 
pass grade, isn’t it?” 

“Yep,” said Fred, dunking an entire roll in his soup, 
transferring it to his mouth, and swallowing it whole. 

“Then you get P for ‘Poor’ ” — Ron raised both his 
arms in mock celebration — “and D for ‘Dreadful.’ ” 

“And then T,” George reminded him. 

“T?” asked Hermione, looking appalled. “Even lower 
than a D? What on earth does that stand for?” 

“ Troll,’ ” said George promptly. 

Harry laughed again, though he was not sure whether 
or not George was joking. He imagined trying to 
conceal from Hermione that he had received T’s in all 



Page | 397Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




his O.W.L.s and immediately resolved to work harder 
from now on. 

“You lot had an inspected lesson yet?” Fred asked 
them. 

“No,” said Hermione at once, “have you?” 

“Just now, before lunch,” said George. “Charms.” 

“What was it like?” Harry and Hermione asked 
together. 

Fred shrugged. 

“Not that bad. Umbridge just lurked in the corner 
making notes on a clipboard. You know what 
Flitwick’s like, he treated her like a guest, didn’t seem 
to bother him at all. She didn’t say much. Asked 
Alicia a couple of questions about what the classes 
are normally like, Alicia told her they were really 
good, that was it.” 

“I can’t see old Flitwick getting marked down,” said 
George, “he usually gets everyone through their 
exams all right.” 

“Who’ve you got this afternoon?” Fred asked Harry. 
“Trelawney — ” 

“A T if ever I saw one — ” 

“ — and Umbridge herself.” 

“Well, be a good boy and keep your temper with 
Umbridge today,” said George. “Angelina’ll do her nut 
if you miss any more Quidditch practices.” 



Page | 398Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




But Harry did not have to wait for Defense Against 
the Dark Arts to meet Professor Umbridge. He was 
pulling out his dream diary in a seat at the very back 
of the shadowy Divination room when Ron elbowed 
him in the ribs and, looking round, he saw Professor 
Umbridge emerging through the trapdoor in the floor. 
The class, which had been talking cheerily, fell silent 
at once. The abrupt fall in the noise level made 
Professor Trelawney, who had been wafting about 
handing out Dream Oracles, look round. 

“Good afternoon, Professor Trelawney,” said Professor 
Umbridge with her wide smile. “You received my note, 

I trust? Giving the time and date of your inspection?” 

Professor Trelawney nodded curtly and, looking very 
disgruntled, turned her back on Professor Umbridge 
and continued to give out books. Still smiling, 
Professor Umbridge grasped the back of the nearest 
armchair and pulled it to the front of the class so that 
it was a few inches behind Professor Trelawney’s seat. 
She then sat down, took her clipboard from her 
flowery bag, and looked up expectantly, waiting for 
the class to begin. 

Professor Trelawney pulled her shawls tight about her 
with slightly trembling hands and surveyed the class 
through her hugely magnifying lenses. “We shall be 
continuing our study of prophetic dreams today,” she 
said in a brave attempt at her usual mystic tones, 
though her voice shook slightly. “Divide into pairs, 
please, and interpret each other’s latest nighttime 
visions with the aid of the Oracle.” 

She made as though to sweep back to her seat, saw 
Professor Umbridge sitting right beside it, and 
immediately veered left toward Parvati and Lavender, 
who were already deep in discussion about Parvati’s 
most recent dream. 

Page | 399Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Harry opened his copy of The Dream Oracle, watching 
Umbridge covertly. She was making notes on her 
clipboard now. After a few minutes she got to her feet 
and began to pace the room in Trelawney’s wake, 
listening to her conversations with students and 
posing questions here and there. Harry bent his head 
hurriedly over his book. 

“Think of a dream, quick,” he told Ron, “in case the 
old toad comes our way.” 

“I did it last time,” Ron protested, “it’s your turn, you 
tell me one.” 

“Oh, I dunno ...” said Harry desperately, who could 
not remember dreaming anything at all over the last 
few days. “Let’s say I dreamed I was ... drowning 
Snape in my cauldron. Yeah, that’ll do...” 

Ron chortled as he opened his Dream Oracle. 

“Okay, we’ve got to add your age to the date you had 
the dream, the number of letters in the subject ... 
would that be ‘drowning’ or ‘cauldron’ or ‘Snape’?” 

“It doesn’t matter, pick any of them,” said Harry, 
chancing a glance behind him. Professor Umbridge 
was now standing at Professor Trelawney’s shoulder 
making notes while the Divination teacher questioned 
Neville about his dream diary. 

“What night did you dream this again?” Ron said, 
immersed in calculations. 

“I dunno, last night, whenever you like,” Harry told 
him, trying to listen to what Umbridge was saying to 
Professor Trelawney. They were only a table away 
from him and Ron now. Professor Umbridge was 



Page | 400Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




making another note on her clipboard and Professor 
Trelawney was looking extremely put out. 

“Now,” said Umbridge, looking up at Trelawney, 
“you’ve been in this post how long, exactly?” 

Professor Trelawney scowled at her, arms crossed and 
shoulders hunched as though wishing to protect 
herself as much as possible from the indignity of the 
inspection. After a slight pause in which she seemed 
to decide that the question was not so offensive that 
she could reasonably ignore it, she said in a deeply 
resentful tone, “Nearly sixteen years.” 

“Quite a period,” said Professor Umbridge, making a 
note on her clipboard. “So it was Professor 
Dumbledore who appointed you?” 

“That’s right,” said Professor Trelawney shortly. 

Professor Umbridge made another note. 

“And you are a great-great-granddaughter of the 
celebrated Seer Cassandra Trelawney?” 

“Yes,” said Professor Trelawney, holding her head a 
little higher. 

Another note on the clipboard. 

“But I think — correct me if I am mistaken — that 
you are the first in your family since Cassandra to be 
possessed of second sight?” 

“These things often skip — er — three generations,” 
said Professor Trelawney. 

Professor Umbridge’s toadlike smile widened. 



Page | 401Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Of course,” she said sweetly, making yet another 
note. “Well, if you could just predict something for 
me, then?” 

She looked up inquiringly, still smiling. Professor 
Trelawney had stiffened as though unable to believe 
her ears. 

“I don’t understand you,” said Professor Trelawney, 
clutching convulsively at the shawl around her 
scrawny neck. 

“I’d like you to make a prediction for me,” said 
Professor Umbridge very clearly. 

Harry and Ron were not the only people watching and 
listening sneakily from behind their books now; most 
of the class were staring transfixed at Professor 
Trelawney as she drew herself up to her full height, 
her beads and bangles clinking. 

“The Inner Eye does not See upon command!” she 
said in scandalized tones. 

“I see,” said Professor Umbridge softly, making yet 
another note on her clipboard. 

“I — but — but ... wait\” said Professor Trelawney 
suddenly, in an attempt at her usual ethereal voice, 
though the mystical effect was ruined somewhat by 
the way it was shaking with anger. “I ... I think I do 
see something ... something that concerns you... Why, 
I sense something . . . something dark . . . some grave 
peril ...” 

Professor Trelawney pointed a shaking finger at 
Professor Umbridge who continued to smile blandly at 
her, eyebrows raised. 



Page | 402Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“I am afraid ... I am afraid that you are in grave 
danger!” Professor Trelawney finished dramatically. 



There was a pause. Professor Umbridge’s eyebrows 
were still raised. 

“Right,” she said softly, scribbling on her clipboard 
once more. “Well, if that’s really the best you can do 



She turned away, leaving Professor Trelawney 
standing rooted to the spot, her chest heaving. Harry 
caught Ron’s eye and knew that Ron was thinking 
exactly the same as he was: They both knew that 
Professor Trelawney was an old fraud, but on the 
other hand, they loathed Umbridge so much that they 
felt very much on Trelawney’s side — until she 
swooped down on them a few seconds later, that was. 

“Well?” she said, snapping her long fingers under 
Harry’s nose, uncharacteristically brisk. “Let me see 
the start you’ve made on your dream diary, please.” 

And by the time she had interpreted Harry’s dreams 
at the top of her voice (all of which, even the ones that 
involved eating porridge, apparently foretold a 
gruesome and early death), he was feeling much less 
sympathetic toward her. All the while, Professor 
Umbridge stood a few feet away, making notes on that 
clipboard, and when the bell rang she descended the 
silver ladder first so that she was waiting for them all 
when they reached their Defense Against the Dark 
Arts lesson ten minutes later. 

She was humming and smiling to herself when they 
entered the room. Harry and Ron told Hermione, who 
had been in Arithmancy, exactly what had happened 
in Divination while they all took out their copies of 
Defensive Magical Theory, but before Hermione could 
Page | 403Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




ask any questions Professor Umbridge had called 
them all to order and silence fell. 

“Wands away,” she instructed them all smilingly, and 
those people who had been hopeful enough to take 
them out sadly returned them to their bags. “As we 
finished chapter one last lesson, I would like you all 
to turn to page nineteen today and commence chapter 
two, ‘Common Defensive Theories and Their 
Derivation. ’ There will be no need to talk.” 

Still smiling her wide, self-satisfied smile, she sat 
down at her desk. The class gave an audible sigh as it 
turned, as one, to page nineteen. Harry wondered 
dully whether there were enough chapters in the book 
to keep them reading through all this year’s lessons 
and was on the point of checking the contents when 
he noticed that Hermione had her hand in the air 
again. 

Professor Umbridge had noticed too, and what was 
more, she seemed to have worked out a strategy for 
just such an eventuality. Instead of trying to pretend 
she had not noticed Hermione, she got to her feet and 
walked around the front row of desks until they were 
face-to-face, then she bent down and whispered, so 
that the rest of the class could not hear, “What is it 
this time, Miss Granger?” 

“I’ve already read chapter two,” said Hermione. 

“Well then, proceed to chapter three.” 

“I’ve read that too. I’ve read the whole book.” 

Professor Umbridge blinked but recovered her poise 
almost instantly. 



Page | 404Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Well, then, you should be able to tell me what 
Slinkhard says about counterjinxes in chapter 
fifteen.” 



“He says that counterjinxes are improperly named,” 
said Hermione promptly. “He says ‘counterjinx’ is just 
a name people give their jinxes when they want to 
make them sound more acceptable.” 

Professor Umbridge raised her eyebrows, and Harry 
knew she was impressed against her will. 

“But I disagree,” Hermione continued. 

Professor Umbridge’s eyebrows rose a little higher and 
her gaze became distinctly colder. 

“You disagree?” 

“Yes, I do,” said Hermione, who, unlike Umbridge, 
was not whispering, but speaking in a clear, carrying 
voice that had by now attracted the rest of the class’s 
attention. “Mr. Slinkhard doesn’t like jinxes, does he? 
But I think they can be very useful when they’re used 
defensively.” 

“Oh, you do, do you?” said Professor Umbridge, 
forgetting to whisper and straightening up. “Well, I’m 
afraid it is Mr. Slinkhard ’s opinion, and not yours, 
that matters within this classroom, Miss Granger.” 

“But — ” Hermione began. 

“That is enough,” said Professor Umbridge. She 
walked back to the front of the class and stood before 
them, all the jauntiness she had shown at the 
beginning of the lesson gone. “Miss Granger, I am 
going to take five points from Gryffindor House.” 

Page | 405Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




There was an outbreak of muttering at this. 

“What for?” said Harry angrily. 

“Don’t you get involved!” Hermione whispered 
urgently to him. 

“For disrupting my class with pointless 
interruptions,” said Professor Umbridge smoothly. “I 
am here to teach you using a Ministry-approved 
method that does not include inviting students to give 
their opinions on matters about which they 
understand very little. Your previous teachers in this 
subject may have allowed you more license, but as 
none of them — with the possible exception of 
Professor Quirrell, who did at least appear to have 
restricted himself to age-appropriate subjects — 
would have passed a Ministry inspection — ” 

“Yeah, Quirrell was a great teacher,” said Harry 
loudly, “there was just that minor drawback of him 
having Lord Voldemort sticking out of the back of his 
head.” 

This pronouncement was followed by one of the 
loudest silences Harry had ever heard. Then — 

“I think another week’s detentions would do you some 
good, Mr. Potter,” said Umbridge sleekly. 

k k k 



The cut on the back of Harry’s hand had barely 
healed and by the following morning, it was bleeding 
again. He did not complain during the evening’s 
detention; he was determined not to give Umbridge 
the satisfaction; over and over again he wrote I must 



Page | 406Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




not tell lies and not a sound escaped his lips, though 
the cut deepened with every letter. 

The very worst part of this second week’s worth of 
detentions was, just as George had predicted, 
Angelina’s reaction. She cornered him just as he 
arrived at the Gryffindor table for breakfast on 
Tuesday and shouted so loudly that Professor 
McGonagall came sweeping down upon the pair of 
them from the staff table. 

“Miss Johnson, how dare you make such a racket in 
the Great Hall! Five points from Gryffindor!” 

“But Professor — he’s gone and landed himself in 
detention again — ” 

“What’s this, Potter?” said Professor McGonagall 
sharply, rounding on Harry. “Detention? From 
whom?” 

“From Professor Umbridge,” muttered Harry, not 
meeting Professor McGonagall’s beady, square-framed 
eyes. 

“Are you telling me,” she said, lowering her voice so 
that the group of curious Ravenclaws behind them 
could not hear, “that after the warning I gave you last 
Monday you lost your temper in Professor Umbridge’s 
class again?” 

“Yes,” Harry muttered, speaking to the floor. 

“Potter, you must get a grip on yourself! You are 
heading for serious trouble! Another five points from 
Gryffindor!” 



Page | 407Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“But — what? Professor, no!” Harry said, furious at 
this injustice. “I’m already being punished by her, 
why do you have to take points as well?” 

“Because detentions do not appear to have any effect 
on you whatsoever!” said Professor McGonagall tartly. 
“No, not another word of complaint, Potter! And as for 
you, Miss Johnson, you will confine your shouting 
matches to the Quidditch pitch in future or risk 
losing the team Captaincy!” 

She strode back toward the staff table. Angelina gave 
Harry a look of deepest disgust and stalked away, 
upon which Harry flung himself onto the bench 
beside Ron, fuming. 

“She’s taken points off Gryffindor because I’m having 
my hand sliced open every night! How is that fair, 
how?” 

“I know, mate,” said Ron sympathetically, tipping 
bacon onto Harry’s plate, “she’s bang out of order.” 

Hermione, however, merely rustled the pages of her 
Daily Prophet and said nothing. 

“You think McGonagall was right, do you?” said Harry 
angrily to the picture of Cornelius Fudge obscuring 
Hermione ’s face. 

“I wish she hadn’t taken points from you, but I think 
she’s right to warn you not to lose your temper with 
Umbridge,” said Hermione’s voice, while Fudge 
gesticulated forcefully from the front page, clearly 
giving some kind of speech. 

Harry did not speak to Hermione all through Charms, 
but when they entered Transfiguration he forgot his 
anger; Professor Umbridge and her clipboard were 

Page | 408Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




sitting in a corner and the sight of her drove the 
memory of breakfast right out of his head. 

“Excellent,” whispered Ron, as they sat down in their 
usual seats. “Let’s see Umbridge get what she 
deserves.” 

Professor McGonagall marched into the room without 
giving the slightest indication that she knew Professor 
Umbridge was there. 

“That will do,” she said and silence fell immediately. 
“Mr. Finnigan, kindly come here and hand back the 
homework — Miss Brown, please take this box of 
mice — don’t be silly, girl, they won’t hurt you — and 
hand one to each student — ” 

“Hem, hem,” said Professor Umbridge, employing the 
same silly little cough she had used to interrupt 
Dumbledore on the first night of term. Professor 
McGonagall ignored her. Seamus handed back 
Harry’s essay; Harry took it without looking at him 
and saw, to his relief, that he had managed an A. 

“Right then, everyone, listen closely — Dean Thomas, 
if you do that to the mouse again I shall put you in 
detention — most of you have now successfully 
vanished your snails and even those who were left 
with a certain amount of shell have the gist of the 
spell. Today we shall be — ” 

“Hem, hem,” said Professor Umbridge. 

“Yes?” said Professor McGonagall, turning round, her 
eyebrows so close together they seemed to form one 
long, severe line. 



Page | 409Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“I was just wondering, Professor, whether you 
received my note telling you of the date and time of 
your inspec — ” 

“Obviously I received it, or I would have asked you 
what you are doing in my classroom,” said Professor 
McGonagall, turning her back firmly on Professor 
Umbridge. Many of the students exchanged looks of 
glee. “As I was saying, today we shall be practicing 
the altogether more difficult vanishment of mice. Now, 
the Vanishing Spell — ” 

“Hem, hem.” 

“I wonder,” said Professor McGonagall in cold fury, 
turning on Professor Umbridge, “how you expect to 
gain an idea of my usual teaching methods if you 
continue to interrupt me? You see, I do not generally 
permit people to talk when I am talking.” 

Professor Umbridge looked as though she had just 
been slapped in the face. She did not speak, but 
straightened the parchment on her clipboard and 
began scribbling furiously. Looking supremely 
unconcerned, Professor McGonagall addressed the 
class once more. 

“As I was saying, the Vanishing Spell becomes more 
difficult with the complexity of the animal to be 
vanished. The snail, as an invertebrate, does not 
present much of a challenge; the mouse, as a 
mammal, offers a much greater one. This is not, 
therefore, magic you can accomplish with your mind 
on your dinner. So — you know the incantation, let 
me see what you can do...” 

“How she can lecture me about not losing my temper 
with Umbridge!” Harry said to Ron under his voice, 



Page | 410Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




but he was grinning; his anger with Professor 
McGonagall had quite evaporated. 

Professor Umbridge did not follow Professor 
McGonagall around the class as she had followed 
Professor Trelawney; perhaps she thought that 
Professor McGonagall would not permit it. She did, 
however, take many more notes while she sat in her 
corner, and when Professor McGonagall finally told 
them all to pack away, rose with a grim expression on 
her face. 

“Well, it’s a start,” said Ron, holding up a long, 
wriggling mouse tail and dropping it back into the box 
Lavender was passing around. 

As they filed out of the classroom, Harry saw 
Professor Umbridge approach the teacher’s desk; he 
nudged Ron, who nudged Hermione in turn, and the 
three of them deliberately fell back to eavesdrop. 

“How long have you been teaching at Hogwarts?” 
Professor Umbridge asked. 

“Thirty-nine years this December,” said Professor 
McGonagall brusquely, snapping her bag shut. 

Professor Umbridge made a note. 

“Very well,” she said, “you will receive the results of 
your inspection in ten days’ time.” 

“I can hardly wait,” said Professor McGonagall in a 
coldly indifferent voice, and she strode off toward the 
door. “Hurry up, you three,” she added, sweeping 
Harry, Ron, and Hermione before her. Harry could not 
help giving her a faint smile and could have sworn he 
received one in return.

He had thought that the next time he would see 
Umbridge would be in his detention that evening, but 
he was wrong. When they walked down the lawns 
toward the forest for Care of Magical Creatures, they 
found her and her clipboard waiting for them beside 
Professor Grubbly-Plank. 

“You do not usually take this class, is that correct?” 
Harry heard her ask as they arrived at the trestle 
table where the group of captive bowtruckles were 
scrabbling around for wood lice like so many living 
twigs. 

“Quite correct,” said Professor Grubbly-Plank, hands 
behind her back and bouncing on the balls of her 
feet. “I am a substitute teacher standing in for 
Professor Hagrid.” 

Harry exchanged uneasy looks with Ron and 
Hermione. Malfoy was whispering with Crabbe and 
Goyle; he would surely love this opportunity to tell 
tales on Hagrid to a member of the Ministry. 

“Hmm,” said Professor Umbridge, dropping her voice, 
though Harry could still hear her quite clearly, “I 
wonder — the headmaster seems strangely reluctant 
to give me any information on the matter — can you 
tell me what is causing Professor Hagrid’s very 
extended leave of absence?” 

Harry saw Malfoy look up eagerly. 

“ ’Fraid I can’t,” said Professor Grubbly-Plank 
breezily. “Don’t know anything more about it than 
you do. Got an owl from Dumbledore, would I like a 
couple of weeks teaching work, accepted — that’s as 
much as I know. Well ... shall I get started then?” 



Page | 412Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Yes, please do,” said Professor Umbridge, scribbling 
upon her clipboard. 

Umbridge took a different tack in this class and 
wandered among the students, questioning them on 
magical creatures. Most people were able to answer 
well and Harry’s spirits lifted somewhat; at least the 
class was not letting Hagrid down. 

“Overall,” said Professor Umbridge, returning to 
Professor Grubbly-Plank’s side after a lengthy 
interrogation of Dean Thomas, “how do you, as a 
temporary member of staff — an objective outsider, I 
suppose you might say — how do you find Hogwarts? 
Do you feel you receive enough support from the 
school management?” 

“Oh, yes, Dumbledore’s excellent,” said Professor 
Grubbly-Plank heartily. “No, I’m very happy with the 
way things are run, very happy indeed.” 

Looking politely incredulous, Umbridge made a tiny 
note on her clipboard and went on, “And what are you 
planning to cover with this class this year — 
assuming, of course, that Professor Hagrid does not 
return?” 

“Oh, I’ll take them through the creatures that most 
often come up in O.W.L.,” said Professor Grubbly- 
Plank. “Not much left to do — they’ve studied 
unicorns and nifflers, I thought we’d cover porlocks 
and kneazles, make sure they can recognize crups 
and knarls, you know...” 

“Well, you seem to know what you’re doing, at any 
rate,” said Professor Umbridge, making a very obvious 
tick on her clipboard. Harry did not like the emphasis 
she put on “you” and liked it even less when she put 



Page | 413Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




her next question to Goyle: “Now, I hear there have 
been injuries in this class?” 

Goyle gave a stupid grin. Malfoy hastened to answer 
the question. 

“That was me,” he said. “I was slashed by a 
hippogriff.” 

“A hippogriff?” said Professor Umbridge, now 
scribbling frantically. 

“Only because he was too stupid to listen to what 
Hagrid told him to do,” said Harry angrily. 

Both Ron and Hermione groaned. Professor Umbridge 
turned her head slowly in Harry’s direction. 

“Another night’s detention, I think,” she said softly. 
“Well, thank you very much, Professor Grubbly-Plank, 
I think that’s all I need here. You will be receiving the 
results of your inspection within ten days.” 

“Jolly good,” said Professor Grubbly-Plank, and 
Professor Umbridge set off back across the lawn to 
the castle. 



ie ie ie 



It was nearly midnight when Harry left Umbridge’s 
office that night, his hand now bleeding so severely 
that it was staining the scarf he had wrapped around 
it. He expected the common room to be empty when 
he returned, but Ron and Hermione had sat up 
waiting for him. He was pleased to see them, 
especially as Hermione was disposed to be 
sympathetic rather than critical. 



Page | 414Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Here,” she said anxiously, pushing a small bowl of 
yellow liquid toward him, “soak your hand in that, it’s 
a solution of strained and pickled murtlap tentacles, 
it should help.” 

Harry placed his bleeding, aching hand into the bowl 
and experienced a wonderful feeling of relief. 
Crookshanks curled around his legs, purring loudly, 
and then leapt into his lap and settled down. 

“Thanks,” he said gratefully, scratching behind 
Crookshanks ’s ears with his left hand. 

“I still reckon you should complain about this,” said 
Ron in a low voice. 

“No,” said Harry flatly. 

“McGonagall would go nuts if she knew — ” 

“Yeah, she probably would,” said Harry. “And how 
long d’you reckon it’d take Umbridge to pass another 
Decree saying anyone who complains about the High 
Inquisitor gets sacked immediately?” 

Ron opened his mouth to retort but nothing came out 
and after a moment he closed it again in a defeated 
sort of way. 

“She’s an awful woman,” said Hermione in a small 
voice. “Awful. You know, I was just saying to Ron 
when you came in ... we’ve got to do something about 
her.” " 

“I suggested poison,” said Ron grimly. 

“No ... I mean, something about what a dreadful 
teacher she is, and how we’re not going to learn any 
defense from her at all,” said Hermione. 

Page | 415Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Well, what can we do about that?” said Ron, 
yawning. “ ’S too late, isn’t it? She got the job, she’s 
here to stay, Fudge’ll make sure of that.” 

“Well,” said Hermione tentatively. “You know, I was 
thinking today...” She shot a slightly nervous look at 
Harry and then plunged on, “I was thinking that — 
maybe the time’s come when we should just — just 
do it ourselves.” 

“Do what ourselves?” said Harry suspiciously, still 
floating his hand in the essence of murtlap tentacles. 

“Well — learn Defense Against the Dark Arts 
ourselves,” said Hermione. 

“Come off it,” groaned Ron. “You want us to do extra 
work? D’you realize Harry and I are behind on 
homework again and it’s only the second week?” 

“But this is much more important than homework!” 
said Hermione. 

Harry and Ron goggled at her. 

“I didn’t think there was anything in the universe 
more important than homework,” said Ron. 

“Don’t be silly, of course there is!” said Hermione, and 
Harry saw, with an ominous feeling, that her face was 
suddenly alight with the kind of fervor that S.P.E.W. 
usually inspired in her. “It’s about preparing 
ourselves, like Harry said in Umbridge’s first lesson, 
for what’s waiting out there. It’s about making sure 
we really can defend ourselves. If we don’t learn 
anything for a whole year — ” 

“We can’t do much by ourselves,” said Ron in a 
defeated voice. “I mean, all right, we can go and look 

Page | 416Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




jinxes up in the library and try and practice them, I 
suppose — ” 

“No, I agree, we’ve gone past the stage where we can 
just learn things out of books,” said Hermione. “We 
need a teacher, a proper one, who can show us how 
to use the spells and correct us if we’re going wrong.” 

“If you’re talking about Lupin ...” Harry began. 

“No, no, I’m not talking about Lupin,” said Hermione. 
“He’s too busy with the Order and anyway, the most 
we could see him is during Hogsmeade weekends and 
that’s not nearly often enough.” 

“Who, then?” said Harry, frowning at her. 

Hermione heaved a very deep sigh. 

“Isn’t it obvious?” she said. “I’m talking about you, 
Harry.” 

There was a moment’s silence. A light night breeze 
rattled the windowpanes behind Ron and the fire 
guttered. 

“About me what?” said Harry. 

“I’m talking about you teaching us Defense Against 
the Dark Arts.” 

Harry stared at her. Then he turned to Ron, ready to 
exchange the exasperated looks they sometimes 
shared when Hermione elaborated on far-fetched 
schemes like S.P.E.W. To Harry’s consternation, 
however, Ron did not look exasperated. He was 
frowning slightly, apparently thinking. Then he said, 
“That’s an idea.” 



Page | 417Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“What’s an idea?” said Harry. 

“You,” said Ron. “Teaching us to do it.” 

“But ...” 

Harry was grinning now, sure the pair of them were 
pulling his leg. 

“But I’m not a teacher, I can’t — ” 

“Harry, you’re the best in the year at Defense Against 
the Dark Arts,” said Hermione. 

“Me?” said Harry, now grinning more broadly than 
ever. “No I’m not, you’ve beaten me in every test — ” 

“Actually, I haven’t,” said Hermione coolly. “You beat 
me in our third year — the only year we both sat the 
test and had a teacher who actually knew the subject 
But I’m not talking about test results, Harry. Look 
what you’ve done\” 

“How d’you mean?” 

“You know what, I’m not sure I want someone this 
stupid teaching me,” Ron said to Hermione, smirking 
slightly. He turned to Harry. “Let’s think,” he said, 
pulling a face like Goyle concentrating. “Uh . . . first 
year — you saved the Stone from You-Know-Who.” 

“But that was luck,” said Harry, “that wasn’t skill — ” 

“Second year,” Ron interrupted, “you killed the 
basilisk and destroyed Riddle.” 

“Yeah, but if Fawkes hadn’t turned up I — ” 



Page | 418Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Third year,” said Ron, louder still, “you fought off 
about a hundred dementors at once — ” 

“You know that was a fluke, if the Time-Turner hadn’t 
?? 



“Last year,” Ron said, almost shouting now, “you 
fought off You-Know-Who again — ” 

“Listen to me!” said Harry, almost angrily, because 
Ron and Hermione were both smirking now. “Just 
listen to me, all right? It sounds great when you say it 
like that, but all that stuff was luck — I didn’t know 
what I was doing half the time, I didn’t plan any of it, 

I just did whatever I could think of, and I nearly 
always had help — ” 

Ron and Hermione were still smirking and Harry felt 
his temper rise; he wasn’t even sure why he was 
feeling so angry. 

“Don’t sit there grinning like you know better than I 
do, I was there, wasn’t I?” he said heatedly. “I know 
what went on, all right? And I didn’t get through any 
of that because I was brilliant at Defense Against the 
Dark Arts, I got through it all because — because 
help came at the right time, or because I guessed 
right — but I just blundered through it all, I didn’t 
have a clue what I was doing — STOP LAUGHING!” 

The bowl of murtlap essence fell to the floor and 
smashed. He became aware that he was on his feet, 
though he couldn’t remember standing up. 
Crookshanks streaked away under a sofa; Ron and 
Hermione ’s smiles had vanished. 

“ You don’t know what it’s likel You — neither of you 
— you’ve never had to face him, have you? You think 
it’s just memorizing a bunch of spells and throwing 

Page | 419Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




them at him, like you’re in class or something? The 
whole time you know there’s nothing between you 
and dying except your own — your own brain or guts 
or whatever — like you can think straight when you 
know you’re about a second from being murdered, or 
tortured, or watching your friends die — they’ve never 
taught us that in their classes, what it’s like to deal 
with things like that — and you two sit there acting 
like I’m a clever little boy to be standing here, alive, 
like Diggory was stupid, like he messed up — you just 
don’t get it, that could just as easily have been me, it 
would have been if Voldemort hadn’t needed me — ” 

“We weren’t saying anything like that, mate,” said 
Ron, looking aghast. “We weren’t having a go at 
Diggory, we didn’t — you’ve got the wrong end of the 



He looked helplessly at Hermione, whose face was 
stricken. 

“Harry,” she said timidly, “don’t you see? This ... this 
is exactly why we need you... We need to know what 
it’s r-really like ... facing him ... facing V-Voldemort.” 

It was the first time she had ever said Voldemort’s 
name, and it was this, more than anything else, that 
calmed Harry. Still breathing hard, he sank back into 
his chair, becoming aware as he did so that his hand 
was throbbing horribly again. He wished he had not 
smashed the bowl of murtlap essence. 

“Well ... think about it,” said Hermione quietly. 
“Please?” 

Harry could not think of anything to say. He was 
feeling ashamed of his outburst already. He nodded, 
hardly aware of what he was agreeing to. 



Page | 420Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Hermione stood up. 

“Well, I’m off to bed,” she said in a voice that was 
clearly as natural as she could make it. “Erm ... 
’night.” 

Ron had gotten to his feet too. 

“Coming?” he said awkwardly to Harry. 

“Yeah,” said Harry. “In ... in a minute. I’ll just clear 
this up.” 

He indicated the smashed bowl on the floor. Ron 
nodded and left. 

“Reparo,” Harry muttered, pointing his wand at the 
broken pieces of china. They flew back together, good 
as new, but there was no returning the murtlap 
essence to the bowl. 

He was suddenly so tired that he was tempted to sink 
back into his armchair and sleep there, but instead 
he got to his feet and followed Ron upstairs. His 
restless night was punctuated once more by dreams 
of long corridors and locked doors, and he awoke next 
day with his scar prickling again.

IN THE HOG’S HEAD 

Hermione made no mention of Harry giving Defense 
Against the Dark Arts lessons for two whole weeks 
after her original suggestion. Harry’s detentions with 
Umbridge were finally over (he doubted whether the 
words now etched on the back of his hand would ever 
fade entirely); Ron had had four more Quidditch 
practices and not been shouted at during the last 
two; and all three of them had managed to vanish 
their mice in Transfiguration (Hermione had actually 
progressed to vanishing kittens), before the subject 
was broached again, on a wild, blustery evening at 
the end of September, when the three of them were 
sitting in the library, looking up potion ingredients for 
Snape. 

“I was wondering,” Hermione said suddenly, “whether 
you’d thought any more about Defense Against the 
Dark Arts, Harry.” 

“ ’Course I have,” said Harry grumpily. “Can’t forget it, 
can we, with that hag teaching us — ” 



Page | 422Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 



“I meant the idea Ron and I had” — Ron cast her an 
alarmed, threatening kind of look; she frowned at him 
— “oh, all right, the idea / had, then — about you 
teaching us.” 

Harry did not answer at once. He pretended to be 
perusing a page of Asiatic Anti-Venoms, because he 
did not want to say what was in his mind. 

The fact was that he had given the matter a great deal 
of thought over the past fortnight. Sometimes it 
seemed an insane idea, just as it had on the night 
Hermione had proposed it, but at others, he had 
found himself thinking about the spells that had 
served him best in his various encounters with Dark 
creatures and Death Eaters — found himself, in fact, 
subconsciously planning lessons... 

“Well,” he said slowly, when he could not pretend to 
find Asiatic anti-venoms interesting much longer, 
“yeah, I — I’ve thought about it a bit.” 

“And?” said Hermione eagerly. 

“I dunno,” said Harry, playing for time. He looked up 
at Ron. 

“I thought it was a good idea from the start,” said 
Ron, who seemed keener to join in this conversation 
now that he was sure that Harry was not going to 
start shouting again. 

Harry shifted uncomfortably in his chair. 

“You did listen to what I said about a load of it being 
luck, didn’t you?” 

“Yes, Harry,” said Hermione gently, “but all the same, 
there’s no point pretending that you’re not good at 

Page | 423Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Defense Against the Dark Arts, because you are. You 
were the only person last year who could throw off the 
Imperius Curse completely, you can produce a 
Patronus, you can do all sorts of stuff that full-grown 
wizards can’t, Viktor always said — ” 

Ron looked around at her so fast he appeared to crick 
his neck; rubbing it, he said, “Yeah? What did Vicky 
say?” 

“Ho ho,” said Hermione in a bored voice. “He said 
Harry knew how to do stuff even he didn’t, and he 
was in the final year at Durmstrang.” 

Ron was looking at Hermione suspiciously. 

“You’re not still in contact with him, are you?” 

“So what if I am?” said Hermione coolly, though her 
face was a little pink. “I can have a pen pal if I — ” 

“He didn’t only want to be your pen pal,” said Ron 
accusingly. 

Hermione shook her head exasperatedly and, ignoring 
Ron, who was continuing to watch her, said to Harry, 
“Well, what do you think? Will you teach us?” 

“Just you and Ron, yeah?” 

“Well,” said Hermione, now looking a mite anxious 
again. “Well ... now, don’t fly off the handle again, 
Harry, please... But I really think you ought to teach 
anyone who wants to learn. I mean, we’re talking 
about defending ourselves against V-Voldemort — oh, 
don’t be pathetic, Ron — it doesn’t seem fair if we 
don’t offer the chance to other people.” 



Page | 424Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Harry considered this for a moment, then said, “Yeah, 
but I doubt anyone except you two would want to be 
taught by me. I’m a nutter, remember?” 

“Well, I think you might be surprised how many 
people would be interested in hearing what you’ve got 
to say,” said Hermione seriously. “Look,” she leaned 
toward him; Ron, who was still watching her with a 
frown on his face, leaned forward to listen too, “you 
know the first weekend in October’s a Hogsmeade 
weekend? How would it be if we tell anyone who’s 
interested to meet us in the village and we can talk it 
over?” 

“Why do we have to do it outside school?” said Ron. 

“Because,” said Hermione, returning to the diagram of 
the Chinese Chomping Cabbage she was copying, “I 
don’t think Umbridge would be very happy if she 
found out what we were up to.” 

Harry had been looking forward to the weekend trip 
into Hogsmeade, but there was one thing worrying 
him. Sirius had maintained a stony silence since he 
had appeared in the fire at the beginning of 
September; Harry knew they had made him angry by 
saying that they did not want him to come — but he 
still worried from time to time that Sirius might throw 
caution to the winds and turn up anyway. What were 
they going to do if the great black dog came bounding 
up the street toward them in Hogsmeade, perhaps 
under the nose of Draco Malfoy? 

“Well, you can’t blame him for wanting to get out and 
about,” said Ron, when Harry discussed his fears 
with him and Hermione. “I mean, he’s been on the 
run for over two years, hasn’t he, and I know that 
can’t have been a laugh, but at least he was free, 



Page | 425Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




wasn’t he? And now he’s just shut up all the time 
with that lunatic elf.” 

Hermione scowled at Ron, but otherwise ignored the 
slight on Kreacher. 

“The trouble is,” she said to Harry, “until V-Voldemort 
— oh for heaven’s sake, Ron — comes out into the 
open, Sirius is going to have to stay hidden, isn’t he? I 
mean, the stupid Ministry isn’t going to realize Sirius 
is innocent until they accept that Dumbledore’s been 
telling the truth about him all along. And once the 
fools start catching real Death Eaters again it’ll be 
obvious Sirius isn’t one ... I mean, he hasn’t got the 
Mark, for one thing.” 

“I don’t reckon he’d be stupid enough to turn up,” 
said Ron bracingly. “Dumbledore’d go mad if he did 
and Sirius listens to Dumbledore even if he doesn’t 
like what he hears.” 

When Harry continued to look worried, Hermione 
said, “Listen, Ron and I have been sounding out 
people who we thought might want to learn some 
proper Defense Against the Dark Arts, and there are a 
couple who seem interested. We’ve told them to meet 
us in Hogsmeade.” 

“Right,” said Harry vaguely, his mind still on Sirius. 

“Don’t worry, Harry,” Hermione said quietly. “You’ve 
got enough on your plate without Sirius too.” 

She was quite right, of course; he was barely keeping 
up with his homework, though he was doing much 
better now that he was no longer spending every 
evening in detention with Umbridge. Ron was even 
further behind with his work than Harry, because 
while they both had Quidditch practices twice a week, 
Page | 426Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Ron also had prefect duties. However, Hermione, who 
was taking more subjects than either of them, had 
not only finished all her homework but was also 
finding time to knit more elf clothes. Harry had to 
admit that she was getting better; it was now almost 
always possible to distinguish between the hats and 
the socks. 

The morning of the Hogsmeade visit dawned bright 
but windy. After breakfast they queued up in front of 
Filch, who matched their names to the long list of 
students who had permission from their parents or 
guardian to visit the village. With a slight pang, Harry 
remembered that if it hadn’t been for Sirius, he would 
not have been going at all. 

When Harry reached Filch, the caretaker gave a great 
sniff as though trying to detect a whiff of something 
from Harry. Then he gave a curt nod that set his jowls 
aquiver again and Harry walked on, out onto the 
stone steps and the cold, sunlit day. 

“Er — why was Filch sniffing you?” asked Ron, as he, 
Harry, and Hermione set off at a brisk pace down the 
wide drive to the gates. 

“I suppose he was checking for the smell of 
Dungbombs,” said Harry with a small laugh. “I forgot 
to tell you ...” 

And he recounted the story of sending his letter to 
Sirius and Filch bursting in seconds later, demanding 
to see the letter. To his slight surprise, Hermione 
found this story highly interesting, much more, 
indeed, than he did himself. 

“He said he was tipped off you were ordering 
Dungbombs? But who had tipped him off?” 



Page | 427Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“I dunno,” said Harry, shrugging. “Maybe Malfoy, he’d 
think it was a laugh.” 

They walked between the tall stone pillars topped 
with winged boars and turned left onto the road into 
the village, the wind whipping their hair into their 
eyes. 

“Malfoy?” said Hermione, very skeptically. “Well ... yes 
... maybe ...” 

And she remained deep in thought all the way into 
the outskirts of Hogsmeade. 

“Where are we going anyway?” Harry asked. “The 
Three Broomsticks?” 

“Oh — no,” said Hermione, coming out of her reverie, 
“no, it’s always packed and really noisy. I’ve told the 
others to meet us in the Hog’s Head, that other pub, 
you know the one, it’s not on the main road. I think 
it’s a bit ... you know ... dodgy ... but students don’t 
normally go in there, so I don’t think we’ll be 
overheard.” 

They walked down the main street past Zonko’s Joke 
Shop, where they were unsurprised to see Fred, 
George, and Lee Jordan, past the post office, from 
which owls issued at regular intervals, and turned up 
a side street at the top of which stood a small inn. A 
battered wooden sign hung from a rusty bracket over 
the door, with a picture upon it of a wild boar’s 
severed head leaking blood onto the white cloth 
around it. The sign creaked in the wind as they 
approached. All three of them hesitated outside the 
door. 

“Well, come on,” said Hermione slightly nervously. 
Harry led the way inside. 

Page | 428Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




It was not at all like the Three Broomsticks, whose 
large bar gave an impression of gleaming warmth and 
cleanliness. The Hog’s Head bar comprised one small, 
dingy, and very dirty room that smelled strongly of 
something that might have been goats. The bay 
windows were so encrusted with grime that very little 
daylight could permeate the room, which was lit 
instead with the stubs of candles sitting on rough 
wooden tables. The floor seemed at first glance to be 
earthy, though as Harry stepped onto it he realized 
that there was stone beneath what seemed to be the 
accumulated filth of centuries. 

Harry remembered Hagrid mentioning this pub in his 
first year: “Yeh get a lot o’ funny folk in the Hog’s 
Head,” he had said, explaining how he had won a 
dragons egg from a hooded stranger there. At the time 
Harry had wondered why Hagrid had not found it odd 
that the stranger kept his face hidden throughout 
their encounter; now he saw that keeping your face 
hidden was something of a fashion in the Hog’s Head. 
There was a man at the bar whose whole head was 
wrapped in dirty gray bandages, though he was still 
managing to gulp endless glasses of some smoking, 
fiery substance through a slit over his mouth. Two 
figures shrouded in hoods sat at a table in one of the 
windows; Harry might have thought them dementors 
if they had not been talking in strong Yorkshire 
accents; in a shadowy corner beside the fireplace sat 
a witch with a thick, black veil that fell to her toes. 
They could just see the tip of her nose because it 
caused the veil to protrude slightly. 

“I don’t know about this, Hermione,” Harry muttered, 
as they crossed to the bar. He was looking 
particularly at the heavily veiled witch. “Has it 
occurred to you Umbridge might be under that?” 

Hermione cast an appraising eye at the veiled figure. 

Page | 429Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Umbridge is shorter than that woman,” she said 
quietly. “And anyway, even if Umbridge does come in 
here there’s nothing she can do to stop us, Harry, 
because I’ve double- and triple-checked the school 
rules. We’re not out-of-bounds; I specifically asked 
Professor Flitwick whether students were allowed to 
come in the Hog’s Head, and he said yes, but he 
advised me strongly to bring our own glasses. And I’ve 
looked up everything I can think of about study 
groups and homework groups and they’re definitely 
allowed. I just don’t think it’s a good idea if we parade 
what we’re doing.” 

“No,” said Harry dryly, “especially as it’s not exactly a 
homework group you’re planning, is it?” 

The barman sidled toward them out of a back room. 
He was a grumpy-looking old man with a great deal of 
long gray hair and beard. He was tall and thin and 
looked vaguely familiar to Harry. 

“What?” he grunted. 

“Three butterbeers, please,” said Hermione. 

The man reached beneath the counter and pulled up 
three very dusty, very dirty bottles, which he 
slammed on the bar. 

“Six Sickles,” he said. 

“I’ll get them,” said Harry quickly, passing over the 
silver. The barman’s eyes traveled over Harry, resting 
for a fraction of a second on his scar. Then he turned 
away and deposited Harry’s money in an ancient 
wooden till whose drawer slid open automatically to 
receive it. Harry, Ron, and Hermione retreated to the 
farthest table from the bar and sat down, looking 
around, while the man in the dirty gray bandages

rapped the counter with his knuckles and received 
another smoking drink from the barman. 



“You know what?” Ron murmured, looking over at the 
bar with enthusiasm. “We could order anything we 
liked in here, I bet that bloke would sell us anything, 
he wouldn’t care. I’ve always wanted to try firewhisky 



“You — are — a — prefect,” snarled Hermione. 

“Oh,” said Ron, the smile fading from his face. “Yeah 



“So who did you say is supposed to be meeting us?” 
Harry asked, wrenching open the rusty top of his 
butterbeer and taking a swig. 

“Just a couple of people,” Hermione repeated, 
checking her watch and then looking anxiously 
toward the door. “I told them to be here about now 
and I’m sure they all know where it is — oh look, this 
might be them now — ” 

The door of the pub had opened. A thick band of 
dusty sunlight split the room in two for a moment 
and then vanished, blocked by the incoming rush of a 
crowd of people. 

First came Neville with Dean and Lavender, who were 
closely followed by Parvati and Padma Patil with 
(Harry’s stomach did a back flip) Cho and one of her 
usually giggling girlfriends, then (on her own and 
looking so dreamy that she might have walked in by 
accident) Luna Lovegood; then Katie Bell, Alicia 
Spinnet, and Angelina Johnson, Colin and Dennis 
Creevey, Ernie Macmillan, Justin Finch-Fletchley, 
Hannah Abbott, and a Hufflepuff girl with a long plait 
down her back whose name Harry did not know; 

Page | 431Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




three Ravenclaw boys he was pretty sure were called 
Anthony Goldstein, Michael Corner, and Terry Boot; 
Ginny, followed by a tall skinny blond boy with an 
upturned nose whom Harry recognized vaguely as 
being a member of the Hufflepuff Quidditch team, and 
bringing up the rear, Fred and George Weasley with 
their friend Lee Jordan, all three of whom were 
carrying large paper bags crammed with Zonko’s 
merchandise. 

“A couple of people?” said Harry hoarsely to 
Hermione. “A couple of people ?” 

“Yes, well, the idea seemed quite popular,” said 
Hermione happily. “Ron, do you want to pull up some 
more chairs?” 

The barman had frozen in the act of wiping out a 
glass with a rag so filthy it looked as though it had 
never been washed. Possibly he had never seen his 
pub so full. 

“Hi,” said Fred, reaching the bar first and counting 
his companions quickly. “Could we have . . . twenty- 
five butterbeers, please?” 

The barman glared at him for a moment, then, 
throwing down his rag irritably as though he had 
been interrupted in something very important, he 
started passing up dusty butterbeers from under the 
bar. 

“Cheers,” said Fred, handing them out. “Cough up, 
everyone, I haven’t got enough gold for all of these...” 

Harry watched numbly as the large chattering group 
took their beers from Fred and rummaged in their 
robes to find coins. He could not imagine what all 
these people had turned up for until the horrible 

Page | 432Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




thought occurred to him that they might be expecting 
some kind of speech, at which he rounded on 
Hermione. 

“What have you been telling people?” he said in a low 
voice. “What are they expecting?” 

“I’ve told you, they just want to hear what you’ve got 
to say,” said Hermione soothingly; but Harry 
continued to look at her so furiously that she added 
quickly, “You don’t have to do anything yet, I’ll speak 
to them first.” 

“Hi, Harry,” said Neville, beaming and taking a seat 
opposite Harry. 

Harry tried to smile back, but did not speak; his 
mouth was exceptionally dry. Cho had just smiled at 
him and sat down on Ron’s right. Her friend, who had 
curly reddish-blonde hair, did not smile, but gave 
Harry a thoroughly mistrustful look that told Harry 
plainly that, given her way, she would not be here at 
all. 

In twos and threes the new arrivals settled around 
Harry, Ron, and Hermione, some looking rather 
excited, others curious, Luna Lovegood gazing 
dreamily into space. When everybody had pulled up a 
chair, the chatter died out. Every eye was upon 
Harry. 

“Er,” said Hermione, her voice slightly higher than 
usual out of nerves. “Well — er — hi.” 

The group focused its attention on her instead, 
though eyes continued to dart back regularly to 
Harry. 



Page | 433Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Well ... erm ... well, you know why you’re here. Erm 
... well, Harry here had the idea — I mean” — Harry 
had thrown her a sharp look — “I had the idea — that 
it might be good if people who wanted to study 
Defense Against the Dark Arts — and I mean, really 
study it, you know, not the rubbish that Umbridge is 
doing with us” — (Hermione’s voice became suddenly 
much stronger and more confident) — “because 
nobody could call that Defense Against the Dark Arts” 
— “Hear, hear,” said Anthony Goldstein, and 
Hermione looked heartened — “well, I thought it 
would be good if we, well, took matters into our own 
hands.” 

She paused, looked sideways at Harry, and went on, 
“And by that I mean learning how to defend ourselves 
properly, not just theory but the real spells — ” 

“You want to pass your Defense Against the Dark Arts 
O.W.L. too though, I bet?” said Michael Corner. 

“Of course I do,” said Hermione at once. “But I want 
more than that, I want to be properly trained in 
Defense because ... because ...” She took a great 
breath and finished, “Because Lord Voldemort’s 
back.” 

The reaction was immediate and predictable. Cho’s 
friend shrieked and slopped butterbeer down herself, 
Terry Boot gave a kind of involuntary twitch, Padma 
Patil shuddered, and Neville gave an odd yelp that he 
managed to turn into a cough. All of them, however, 
looked fixedly, even eagerly, at Harry. 

“Well ... that’s the plan anyway,” said Hermione. “If 
you want to join us, we need to decide how we’re 
going to — ” 



Page | 434Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Where’s the proof You-Know- Who’s back?” said the 
blond Hufflepuff player in a rather aggressive voice. 

“Well, Dumbledore believes it — ” Hermione began. 

“You mean, Dumbledore believes him,” said the blond 
boy, nodding at Harry. 

“Who are you?” said Ron rather rudely. 

“Zacharias Smith,” said the boy, “and I think we’ve 
got the right to know exactly what makes him say 
You-Know-Who’s back.” 

“Look,” said Hermione, intervening swiftly, “that’s 
really not what this meeting was supposed to be 
about — ” 

“It’s okay, Hermione,” said Harry. 

It had just dawned upon him why there were so many 
people there. He felt that Hermione should have seen 
this coming. Some of these people — maybe even 
most of them — had turned up in the hope of hearing 
Harry’s story firsthand. 

“What makes me say You-Know-Who’s back?” he 
asked, looking Zacharias straight in the face. “I saw 
him. But Dumbledore told the whole school what 
happened last year, and if you didn’t believe him, you 
don’t believe me, and I’m not wasting an afternoon 
trying to convince anyone.” 

The whole group seemed to have held its breath while 
Harry spoke. Harry had the impression that even the 
barman was listening in. He was wiping the same 
glass with the filthy rag; it was becoming steadily 
dirtier. 



Page | 435Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Zacharias said dismissively, “All Dumbledore told us 
last year was that Cedric Diggory got killed by You- 
Know-Who and that you brought Diggory’s body back 
to Hogwarts. He didn’t give us details, he didn’t tell us 
exactly how Diggory got murdered, I think we’d all 
like to know — ” 

“If you’ve come to hear exactly what it looks like when 
Voldemort murders someone I can’t help you,” Harry 
said. His temper, always so close to the surface these 
days, was rising again. He did not take his eyes from 
Zacharias Smith’s aggressive face, determined not to 
look at Cho. “I don’t want to talk about Cedric 
Diggory, all right? So if that’s what you’re here for, 
you might as well clear out.” 

He cast an angry look in Hermione’s direction. This 
was, he felt, all her fault; she had decided to display 
him like some sort of freak and of course they had all 
turned up to see just how wild his story was... But 
none of them left their seats, not even Zacharias 
Smith, though he continued to gaze intently at Harry. 

“So,” said Hermione, her voice very high-pitched 
again. “So ... like I was saying ... if you want to learn 
some defense, then we need to work out how we’re 
going to do it, how often we’re going to meet, and 
where we’re going to — ” 

“Is it true,” interrupted the girl with the long plait 
down her back, looking at Harry, “that you can 
produce a Patronus?” 

There was a murmur of interest around the group at 
this. 

“Yeah,” said Harry slightly defensively. 

“A corporeal Patronus?” 

Page | 436Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




The phrase stirred something in Harry’s memory. 



“Er — you don’t know Madam Bones, do you?” he 
asked. 

The girl smiled. 

“She’s my auntie,” she said. “I’m Susan Bones. She 
told me about your hearing. So — is it really true? 

You make a stag Patronus?” 

“Yes,” said Harry. 

“Blimey, Harry!” said Lee, looking deeply impressed. “I 
never knew that!” 

“Mum told Ron not to spread it around,” said Fred, 
grinning at Harry. “She said you got enough attention 
as it was.” 

“She’s not wrong,” mumbled Harry and a couple of 
people laughed. The veiled witch sitting alone shifted 
very slightly in her seat. 

“And did you kill a basilisk with that sword in 
Dumbledore’s office?” demanded Terry Boot. “That’s 
what one of the portraits on the wall told me when I 
was in there last year...” 

“Er — yeah, I did, yeah,” said Harry. 

Justin Finch-Fletchley whistled, the Creevey brothers 
exchanged awestruck looks, and Lavender Brown said 
“wow” softly. Harry was feeling slightly hot around the 
collar now; he was determinedly looking anywhere 
but at Cho. 

“And in our first year,” said Neville to the group at 
large, “he saved that Sorcerous Stone — ” 

Page | 437Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Sorcerer’s,” hissed Hermione. 

“Yes, that, from You-Know-Who,” finished Neville. 

Hannah Abbott’s eyes were as round as Galleons. 

“And that’s not to mention,” said Cho (Harry’s eyes 
snapped onto her, she was looking at him, smiling; 
his stomach did another somersault), “all the tasks he 
had to get through in the Triwizard Tournament last 
year — getting past dragons and merpeople and 
acromantulas and things...” 

There was a murmur of impressed agreement around 
the table. 

Harry’s insides were squirming. He was trying to 
arrange his face so that he did not look too pleased 
with himself. The fact that Cho had just praised him 
made it much, much harder for him to say the thing 
he had sworn to himself he would tell them. 

“Look,” he said and everyone fell silent at once, “I ... I 
don’t want to sound like I’m trying to be modest or 
anything, but ... I had a lot of help with all that 
stuff...” 

“Not with the dragon, you didn’t,” said Michael Corner 
at once. “That was a seriously cool bit of flying...” 

“Yeah, well — ” said Harry, feeling it would be churlish 
to disagree. 

“And nobody helped you get rid of those dementors 
this summer,” said Susan Bones. 

“No,” said Harry, “no, okay, I know I did bits of it 
without help, but the point I’m trying to make is — ” 



Page | 438Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Are you trying to weasel out of showing us any of 
this stuff?” said Zacharias Smith. 

“Here’s an idea,” said Ron loudly, before Harry could 
speak, “why don’t you shut your mouth?” 

Perhaps the word “weasel” had affected Ron 
particularly strongly; in any case, he was now looking 
at Zacharias as though he would like nothing better 
than to thump him. Zacharias flushed. 

“Well, we’ve all turned up to learn from him, and now 
he’s telling us he can’t really do any of it,” he said. 

“That’s not what he said,” snarled Fred Weasley. 

“Would you like us to clean out your ears for you?” 
inquired George, pulling a long and lethal-looking 
metal instrument from inside one of the Zonko’s bags. 

“Or any part of your body, really, we’re not fussy 
where we stick this,” said Fred. 

“Yes, well,” said Hermione hastily, “moving on ... the 
point is, are we agreed we want to take lessons from 
Harry?” 

There was a murmur of general agreement. Zacharias 
folded his arms and said nothing, though perhaps 
this was because he was too busy keeping an eye on 
the instrument in George’s hand. 

“Right,” said Hermione, looking relieved that 
something had at last been settled. “Well, then, the 
next question is how often we do it. I really don’t 
think there’s any point in meeting less than once a 
week — ” 



Page | 439Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Hang on,” said Angelina, “we need to make sure this 
doesn’t clash with our Quidditch practice.” 

“No,” said Cho, “nor with ours.” 

“Nor ours,” added Zacharias Smith. 

“I’m sure we can find a night that suits everyone,” 
said Hermione, slightly impatiently, “but you know, 
this is rather important, we’re talking about learning 
to defend ourselves against V-Voldemort’s Death 
Eaters — ” 

“Well said!” barked Ernie Macmillan, whom Harry had 
been expecting to speak long before this. “Personally I 
think this is really important, possibly more 
important than anything else we’ll do this year, even 
with our O.W.L.s coming up!” 

He looked around impressively, as though waiting for 
people to cry, “Surely not!” When nobody spoke, he 
went on, “I, personally, am at a loss to see why the 
Ministry has foisted such a useless teacher upon us 
at this critical period. Obviously they are in denial 
about the return of You-Know-Who, but to give us a 
teacher who is trying to actively prevent us from 
using defensive spells — ” 

“We think the reason Umbridge doesn’t want us 
trained in Defense Against the Dark Arts,” said 
Hermione, “is that she’s got some ... some mad idea 
that Dumbledore could use the students in the school 
as a kind of private army. She thinks he’d mobilize us 
against the Ministry.” 

Nearly everybody looked stunned at this news; 
everybody except Luna Lovegood, who piped up, 

“Well, that makes sense. After all, Cornelius Fudge 
has got his own private army.” 

Page | 440Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“What?” said Harry, completely thrown by this 
unexpected piece of information. 

“Yes, he’s got an army of heliopaths,” said Luna 
solemnly. 

“No, he hasn’t,” snapped Hermione. 

“Yes, he has,” said Luna. 

“What are heliopaths?” asked Neville, looking blank. 

“They’re spirits of fire,” said Luna, her protuberant 
eyes widening so that she looked madder than ever. 
“Great tall flaming creatures that gallop across the 
ground burning everything in front of — ” 

“They don’t exist, Neville,” said Hermione tartly. 

“Oh yes they do!” said Luna angrily. 

“I’m sorry, but where’s the proof of that?” snapped 
Hermione. 

“There are plenty of eyewitness accounts, just 
because you’re so narrow-minded you need to have 
everything shoved under your nose before you — ” 

“Hem, hem,” said Ginny in such a good imitation of 
Professor Umbridge that several people looked around 
in alarm and then laughed. “Weren’t we trying to 
decide how often we’re going to meet and get Defense 
lessons?” 

“Yes,” said Hermione at once, “yes, we were, you’re 
right...” 

“Well, once a week sounds cool,” said Lee Jordan. 



Page | 441Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“As long as — ” began Angelina. 



“Yes, yes, we know about the Quidditch,” said 
Hermione in a tense voice. “Well, the other thing to 
decide is where we’re going to meet...” 

This was rather more difficult; the whole group fell 
silent. 

“Library?” suggested Katie Bell after a few moments. 

“I can’t see Madam Pince being too chuffed with us 
doing jinxes in the library,” said Harry. 

“Maybe an unused classroom?” said Dean. 

“Yeah,” said Ron, “McGonagall might let us have hers, 
she did when Harry was practicing for the 
Tri wizard...” 

But Harry was pretty certain that McGonagall would 
not be so accommodating this time. For all that 
Hermione had said about study and homework 
groups being allowed, he had the distinct feeling this 
one might be considered a lot more rebellious. 

“Right, well, we’ll try to find somewhere,” said 
Hermione. “We’ll send a message round to everybody 
when we’ve got a time and a place for the first 
meeting.” 

She rummaged in her bag and produced parchment 
and a quill, then hesitated, rather as though she was 
steeling herself to say something. 

“I-I think everybody should write their name down, 
just so we know who was here. But I also think,” she 
took a deep breath, “that we all ought to agree not to 
shout about what we’re doing. So if you sign, you’re 

Page | 442Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




agreeing not to tell Umbridge — or anybody else 
what we’re up to.” 



Fred reached out for the parchment and cheerfully 
put down his signature, but Harry noticed at once 
that several people looked less than happy at the 
prospect of putting their names on the list. 

“Er ...” said Zacharias slowly, not taking the 
parchment that George was trying to pass him. “Well 
... I’m sure Ernie will tell me when the meeting is.” 

But Ernie was looking rather hesitant about signing 
too. Hermione raised her eyebrows at him. 

“I — well, we are prefects,” Ernie burst out. “And if 
this list was found ... well, I mean to say ... you said 
yourself, if Umbridge finds out ...” 

“You just said this group was the most important 
thing you’d do this year,” Harry reminded him. 

“I — yes,” said Ernie, “yes, I do believe that, it’s just 



“Ernie, do you really think I’d leave that list lying 
around?” said Hermione testily. 

“No. No, of course not,” said Ernie, looking slightly 
less anxious. “I — yes, of course I’ll sign.” 

Nobody raised objections after Ernie, though Harry 
saw Cho’s friend give her a rather reproachful look 
before adding her name. When the last person — 
Zacharias — had signed, Hermione took the 
parchment back and slipped it carefully into her bag. 
There was an odd feeling in the group now. It was as 
though they had just signed some kind of contract. 

Page | 443Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Well, time’s ticking on,” said Fred briskly, getting to 
his feet. “George, Lee, and I have got items of a 
sensitive nature to purchase, we’ll be seeing you all 
later.” 

In twos and threes the rest of the group took their 
leave too. Cho made rather a business of fastening 
the catch on her bag before leaving, her long dark 
curtain of hair swinging forward to hide her face, but 
her friend stood beside her, arms folded, clicking her 
tongue, so that Cho had little choice but to leave with 
her. As her friend ushered her through the door, Cho 
looked back and waved at Harry. 

“Well, I think that went quite well,” said Hermione 
happily, as she, Harry, and Ron walked out of the 
Hog’s Head into the bright sunlight a few moments 
later, Harry and Ron still clutching their bottles of 
butterbeer. 

“That Zacharias bloke’s a wart,” said Ron, who was 
glowering after the figure of Smith just discernible in 
the distance. 

“I don’t like him much either,” admitted Hermione, 
“but he overheard me talking to Ernie and Hannah at 
the Hufflepuff table and he seemed really interested 
in coming, so what could I say? But the more people 
the better really — I mean, Michael Corner and his 
friends wouldn’t have come if he hadn’t been going 
out with Ginny — ” 

Ron, who had been draining the last few drops from 
his butterbeer bottle, gagged and sprayed butterbeer 
down his front. 

“He’s WHAT?” said Ron, outraged, his ears now 
resembling curls of raw beef. “She’s going out with — 



Page | 444Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




my sister’s going — what d’you mean, Michael 
Corner?” 

“Well, that’s why he and his friends came, I think — 
well, they’re obviously interested in learning defense, 
but if Ginny hadn’t told Michael what was going on — 



“When did this — when did she — ?” 

“They met at the Yule Ball and they got together at 
the end of last year,” said Hermione composedly. They 
had turned into the High Street and she paused 
outside Scrivenshaft’s Quill Shop, where there was a 
handsome display of pheasant-feather quills in the 
window. “Hmm ... I could do with a new quill.” 

She turned into the shop. Harry and Ron followed 
her. 

“Which one was Michael Corner?” Ron demanded 
furiously. 

“The dark one,” said Hermione. 

“I didn’t like him,” said Ron at once. 

“Big surprise,” said Hermione under her breath. 

“But,” said Ron, following Hermione along a row of 
quills in copper pots, “I thought Ginny fancied Harry!” 

Hermione looked at him rather pityingly and shook 
her head. 

“Ginny used to fancy Harry, but she gave up on him 
months ago. Not that she doesn’t like you, of course,” 
she added kindly to Harry while she examined a long 
black-and-gold quill. 

Page | 445Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Harry, whose head was still full of Cho’s parting wave, 
did not find this subject quite as interesting as Ron, 
who was positively quivering with indignation, but it 
did bring something home to him that until now he 
had not really registered. 

“So that’s why she talks now?” he asked Hermione. 
“She never used to talk in front of me.” 

“Exactly,” said Hermione. “Yes, I think I’ll have this 
one...” 

She went up to the counter and handed over fifteen 
Sickles and two Knuts, Ron still breathing down her 
neck. 

“Ron,” she said severely as she turned and trod on his 
feet, “this is exactly why Ginny hasn’t told you she’s 
seeing Michael, she knew you’d take it badly. So don’t 
harp on about it, for heaven’s sake.” 

“What d’you mean, who’s taking anything badly? I’m 
not going to harp on about anything ...” 

Ron continued to chunter under his breath all the 
way down the street. Hermione rolled her eyes at 
Harry and then said in an undertone, while Ron was 
muttering imprecations about Michael Corner, “And 
talking about Michael and Ginny . . . what about Cho 
and you?” 

“What d’you mean?” said Harry quickly. 

It was as though boiling water was rising rapidly 
inside him; a burning sensation that was causing his 
face to smart in the cold — had he been that obvious? 

“Well,” said Hermione, smiling slightly, “she just 
couldn’t keep her eyes off you, could she?” 

Page | 446Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Harry had never before appreciated just how beautiful 
the village of Hogsmeade was. 



Page | 447Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 





EDUCATIONAL DECREE NUMBER 
TWENTY-FOUR 

Harry felt happier for the rest of the weekend than he 
had done all term. He and Ron spent much of Sunday 
catching up with all their homework again, and 
although this could hardly be called fun, the last 
burst of autumn sunshine persisted, so rather than 
sitting hunched over tables in the common room, they 
took their work outside and lounged in the shade of a 
large beech tree on the edge of the lake. Hermione, 
who of course was up to date with all her work, 
brought more wool outside with her and bewitched 
her knitting needles so that they flashed and clicked 
in midair beside her, producing more hats and 
scarves. 

The knowledge that they were doing something to 
resist Umbridge and the Ministry, and that he was a 
key part of the rebellion, gave Harry a feeling of 
immense satisfaction. He kept reliving Saturday’s 
meeting in his mind: all those people, coming to him 
to learn Defense Against the Dark Arts . . . and the 
looks on their faces as they had heard some of the 



Page | 448Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 



things he had done . . . and Cho praising his 
performance in the Triwizard Tournament... The 
knowledge that all those people did not think him a 
lying weirdo, but someone to be admired, buoyed him 
up so much that he was still cheerful on Monday 
morning, despite the imminent prospect of all his 
least favorite classes. 

He and Ron headed downstairs from their dormitory 
together, discussing Angelina’s idea that they were to 
work on a new move called the Sloth Grip Roll during 
that night’s Quidditch practice, and not until they 
were halfway across the sunlit common room did they 
notice the addition to the room that had already 
attracted the attention of a small group of people. 

A large sign had been affixed to the Gryffindor notice 
board, so large that it covered everything else on there 
— the lists of secondhand spellbooks for sale, the 
regular reminders of school rules from Argus Filch, 
the Quidditch team training schedule, the offers to 
barter certain Chocolate Frog cards for others, the 
Weasleys’ new advertisement for testers, the dates of 
the Hogsmeade weekends, and the lost-and-found 
notices. The new sign was printed in large black 
letters and there was a highly official-looking seal at 
the bottom beside a neat and curly signature. 



— BY ORDER OF — 

THE HIGH INQUISITOR OF HOGWARTS 

All Student Organizations, Societies, Teams, Groups, 
and Clubs are henceforth disbanded. 



Page | 449Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




An Organization, Society, Team, Group, or Club is 
hereby defined as a regular meeting of three or more 
students. 

Permission to re-form may be sought from the High 
Inquisitor (Professor Umbridge). 

No Student Organization, Society, Team, Group, or 
Club may exist without the knowledge and approval 
of the High Inquisitor. 

Any student found to have formed, or to belong to, an 
Organization, Society, Team, Group, or Club that has 
not been approved by the High Inquisitor will be 
expelled. 

The above is in accordance with 
Educational Decree Number Twenty-four. 

Signed: 

Dolores Jane Umbridge 
HIGH INQUISITOR 

Harry and Ron read the notice over the heads of some 
anxious-looking second years. 

“Does this mean they’re going to shut down the 
Gobstones Club?” one of them asked his friend. 

“I reckon you’ll be okay with Gobstones,” Ron said 
darkly, making the second year jump. “I don’t think 
we’re going to be as lucky, though, do you?” he asked 
Harry as the second years hurried away. 



Page | 450Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Harry was reading the notice through again. The 
happiness that had filled him since Saturday was 
gone. His insides were pulsing with rage. 

“This isn’t a coincidence,” he said, his hands forming 
fists. “She knows.” 

“She can’t,” said Ron at once. 

“There were people listening in that pub. And let’s 
face it, we don’t know how many of the people who 
turned up we can trust... Any of them could have run 
off and told Umbridge...” 

And he had thought they believed him, thought they 
even admired him . . . 

“Zacharias Smith!” said Ron at once, punching a fist 
into his hand. “Or — I thought that Michael Corner 
had a really shifty look too — ” 

“I wonder if Hermione’s seen this yet?” Harry said, 
looking around at the door to the girls’ dormitories. 

“Let’s go and tell her,” said Ron. He bounded forward, 
pulled open the door, and set off up the spiral 
staircase. 

He was on the sixth stair when it happened. There 
was a loud, wailing, klaxonlike sound and the steps 
melted together to make a long, smooth stone slide. 
There was a brief moment when Ron tried to keep 
running, arms working madly like windmills, then he 
toppled over backward and shot down the newly 
created slide, coming to rest on his back at Harry’s 
feet.

“Er — I don’t think we’re allowed in the girls’ 
dormitories,” said Harry, pulling Ron to his feet and 
trying not to laugh. 

Two fourth-year girls came zooming gleefully down 
the stone slide. 

“Oooh, who tried to get upstairs?” they giggled 
happily, leaping to their feet and ogling Harry and 
Ron. 

“Me,” said Ron, who was still rather disheveled. “I 
didn’t realize that would happen. It’s not fair!” he 
added to Harry, as the girls headed off for the portrait 
hole, still giggling madly. “Hermione’s allowed in our 
dormitory, how come we’re not allowed — ?” 

“Well, it’s an old-fashioned rule,” said Hermione, who 
had just slid neatly onto a rug in front of them and 
was now getting to her feet, “but it says in Hogwarts, 
A History that the founders thought boys were less 
trustworthy than girls. Anyway, why were you trying 
to get in there?” 

“To see you — look at this!” said Ron, dragging her 
over to the notice board. 

Hermione’s eyes slid rapidly down the notice. Her 
expression became stony. 

“Someone must have blabbed to her!” Ron said 
angrily. 

“They can’t have done,” said Hermione in a low voice. 

“You’re so naive,” said Ron, “you think just because 
you’re all honorable and trustworthy — ” 



Page | 452Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“No, they can’t have done because I put a jinx on that 
piece of parchment we all signed,” said Hermione 
grimly. “Believe me, if anyone’s run off and told 
Umbridge, well know exactly who they are and they 
will really regret it.” 

“What’ll happen to them?” said Ron eagerly. 

“Well, put it this way,” said Hermione, “it’ll make 
Eloise Midgen’s acne look like a couple of cute 
freckles. Come on, let’s get down to breakfast and see 
what the others think. . . I wonder whether this has 
been put up in all the Houses?” 

It was immediately apparent on entering the Great 
Hall that Umbridge’s sign had not only appeared in 
Gryffindor Tower. There was a peculiar intensity 
about the chatter and an extra measure of movement 
in the Hall as people scurried up and down their 
tables conferring on what they had read. Harry, Ron, 
and Hermione had barely taken their seats when 
Neville, Dean, Fred, George, and Ginny descended 
upon them. 

“Did you see it?” 

“D’you reckon she knows?” 

“What are we going to do?” 

They were all looking at Harry. He glanced around to 
make sure there were no teachers near them. 

“We’re going to do it anyway, of course,” he said 
quietly. 

“Knew you’d say that,” said George, beaming and 
thumping Harry on the arm. 



Page | 453Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“The prefects as well?” said Fred, looking quizzically 
at Ron and Hermione. 

“Of course,” said Hermione coolly. 

“Here comes Ernie and Hannah Abbott,” said Ron, 
looking over his shoulder. “And those Ravenclaw 
blokes and Smith ... and no one looks very spotty.” 

Hermione looked alarmed. 

“Never mind spots, the idiots can’t come over here 
now, it’ll look really suspicious — sit down!” she 
mouthed to Ernie and Hannah, gesturing frantically 
to them to rejoin the Hufflepuff table. “Later! We’ll — 
talk — to — you — lateri” 

“I’ll tell Michael,” said Ginny impatiently, swinging 
herself off her bench. “The fool, honestly ...” 

She hurried off toward the Ravenclaw table; Harry 
watched her go. Cho was sitting not far away, talking 
to the curly-haired friend she had brought along to 
the Hog’s Head. Would Umbridge’s notice scare her off 
meeting them again? 

But the full repercussions of the sign were not felt 
until they were leaving the Great Hall for History of 
Magic. 

“Harry! Ron\” 

It was Angelina and she was hurrying toward them 
looking perfectly desperate. 

“It’s okay,” said Harry quietly, when she was near 
enough to hear him. “We’re still going to — ” 



Page | 454Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“You realize she’s including Quidditch in this?” 
Angelina said over him. “We have to go and ask 
permission to re-form the Gryffindor team!” 

“What?” said Harry. 

“No way,” said Ron, appalled. 

“You read the sign, it mentions teams too! So listen, 
Harry ... I am saying this for the last time... Please, 
please don’t lose your temper with Umbridge again or 
she might not let us play anymore!” 

“Okay, okay,” said Harry, for Angelina looked as 
though she was on the verge of tears. “Don’t worry, I’ll 
behave myself...” 

“Bet Umbridge is in History of Magic,” said Ron 
grimly, as they set off for Binns’s lesson. “She hasn’t 
inspected Binns yet... Bet you anything she’s there...” 

But he was wrong; the only teacher present when 
they entered was Professor Binns, floating an inch or 
so above his chair as usual and preparing to continue 
his monotonous drone on giant wars. Harry did not 
even attempt to follow what he was saying today; he 
doodled idly on his parchment ignoring Hermione’s 
frequent glares and nudges, until a particularly 
painful poke in the ribs made him look up angrily. 

“What?” 

She pointed at the window. Harry looked around. 
Hedwig was perched on the narrow window ledge, 
gazing through the thick glass at him, a letter tied to 
her leg. Harry could not understand it; they had just 
had breakfast, why on earth hadn’t she delivered the 
letter then, as usual? Many of his classmates were 
pointing out Hedwig to each other too. 

Page | 455Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Oh, I’ve always loved that owl, she’s so beautiful,” 
Harry heard Lavender sigh to Parvati. 



He glanced around at Professor Binns who continued 
to read his notes, serenely unaware that the class’s 
attention was even less focused upon him than usual. 
Harry slipped quietly off his chair, crouched down, 
and hurried along the row to the window, where he 
slid the catch and opened it very slowly. 

He had expected Hedwig to hold out her leg so that he 
could remove the letter and then fly off to the Owlery, 
but the moment the window was open wide enough 
she hopped inside, hooting dolefully. He closed the 
window with an anxious glance at Professor Binns, 
crouched low again, and sped back to his seat with 
Hedwig on his shoulder. He regained his seat, 
transferred Hedwig to his lap, and made to remove 
the letter tied to her leg. 

It was only then that he realized that Hedwig’s 
feathers were oddly ruffled; some were bent the wrong 
way, and she was holding one of her wings at an odd 
angle. 

“She’s hurt!” Harry whispered, bending his head low 
over her. Hermione and Ron leaned in closer; 
Hermione even put down her quill. “Look — there’s 
something wrong with her wing — ” 

Hedwig was quivering; when Harry made to touch the 
wing she gave a little jump, all her feathers on end as 
though she was inflating herself, and gazed at him 
reproachfully. 

“Professor Binns,” said Harry loudly, and everyone in 
the class turned to look at him. “I’m not feeling well.” 



Page | 456Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Professor Binns raised his eyes from his notes, 
looking amazed, as always, to find the room in front 
of him full of people. 

“Not feeling well?” he repeated hazily. 

“Not at all well,” said Harry firmly, getting to his feet 
while concealing Hedwig behind his back. “So I think 
I’ll need to go to the hospital wing.” 

“Yes,” said Professor Binns, clearly very much wrong- 
footed. “Yes ... yes, hospital wing ... well, off you go, 
then, Perkins ...” 

Once outside the room Harry returned Hedwig to his 
shoulder and hurried off up the corridor, pausing to 
think only when he was out of sight of Binns’s door. 
His first choice of somebody to cure Hedwig would 
have been Hagrid, of course, but as he had no idea 
where Hagrid was, his only remaining option was to 
find Professor Grubbly-Plank and hope she would 
help. 

He peered out of a window at the blustery, overcast 
grounds. There was no sign of her anywhere near 
Hagrid’s cabin; if she was not teaching, she was 
probably in the staffroom. He set off downstairs, 
Hedwig hooting feebly as she swayed on his shoulder. 

Two stone gargoyles flanked the staffroom door. As 
Harry approached, one of them croaked, “You should 
be in class, sunny Jim.” 

“This is urgent,” said Harry curtly. 

“Ooooh, urgent, is it?” said the other gargoyle in a 
high-pitched voice. “Well, that’s put us in our place, 
hasn’t it?” 



Page | 457Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Harry knocked; he heard footsteps and then the door 
opened and he found himself face-to-face with 
Professor McGonagall. 

“You haven’t been given another detention!” she said 
at once, her square spectacles flashing alarmingly. 

“No, Professor!” said Harry hastily. 

“Well then, why are you out of class?” 

“It’s urgent, apparently,” said the second gargoyle 
snidely. 

“I’m looking for Professor Grubbly-Plank,” Harry 
explained. “It’s my owl, she’s injured.” 

“Injured owl, did you say?” 

Professor Grubbly-Plank appeared at Professor 
McGonagall’s shoulder, smoking a pipe and holding a 
copy of the Daily Prophet 

“Yes,” said Harry, lifting Hedwig carefully off his 
shoulder, “she turned up after the other post owls 
and her wing’s all funny, look — ” 

Professor Grubbly-Plank stuck her pipe firmly 
between her teeth and took Hedwig from Harry while 
Professor McGonagall watched. 

“Hmm,” said Professor Grubbly-Plank, her pipe 
waggling slightly as she talked. “Looks like 
something’s attacked her. Can’t think what would 
have done it, though... Thestrals will sometimes go for 
birds, of course, but Hagrid’s got the Hogwarts 
thestrals well trained not to touch owls ...” 



Page | 458Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Harry neither knew nor cared what thestrals were, he 
just wanted to know that Hedwig was going to be all 
right. Professor McGonagall, however, looked sharply 
at Harry and said, “Do you know how far this owl’s 
traveled, Potter?” 

“Er,” said Harry. “From London, I think.” 

He met her eyes briefly and knew that she understood 
“London” to mean “number twelve, Grimmauld Place” 
by the way her eyebrows had joined in the middle. 

Professor Grubbly-Plank pulled a monocle out of the 
inside of her robes and screwed it into her eye to 
examine Hedwig’s wing closely. “I should be able to 
sort this out if you leave her with me, Potter,” she 
said. “She shouldn’t be flying long distances for a few 
days, in any case.” 

“Er — right — thanks,” said Harry, just as the bell 
rang for break. 

“No problem,” said Professor Grubbly-Plank gruffly, 
turning back into the staffroom. 

“Just a moment, Wilhelmina!” said Professor 
McGonagall. “Potter’s letter!” 

“Oh yeah!” said Harry, who had momentarily 
forgotten the scroll tied to Hedwig’s leg. Professor 
Grubbly-Plank handed it over and then disappeared 
into the staffroom carrying Hedwig, who was staring 
at Harry as though unable to believe he would give 
her away like this. Feeling slightly guilty, he turned to 
go, but Professor McGonagall called him back. 

“Potter!” 

“Yes, Professor?” 

Page | 459Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




She glanced up and down the corridor; there were 
students coming from both directions. 

“Bear in mind,” she said quickly and quietly, her eyes 
on the scroll in his hand, “that channels of 
communication in and out of Hogwarts may be being 
watched, won’t you?” 

“I — ” said Harry, but the flood of students rolling 
along the corridor was almost upon him. Professor 
McGonagall gave him a curt nod and retreated into 
the staffroom, leaving Harry to be swept out into the 
courtyard with the crowd. Here he spotted Ron and 
Hermione already standing in a sheltered corner, 
their cloak collars turned up against the wind. Harry 
slit open the scroll as he hurried toward them and 
found five words in Sirius’s handwriting: 

Today, same time, same place. 

“Is Hedwig okay?” asked Hermione anxiously, the 
moment he was within earshot. 

“Where did you take her?” asked Ron. 

“To Grubbly-Plank,” said Harry. “And I met 
McGonagall... Listen...” 

And he told them what Professor McGonagall had 
said. To his surprise, neither of the others looked 
shocked; on the contrary, they exchanged significant 
looks. 

“What?” said Harry, looking from Ron to Hermione 
and back again. 

“Well, I was just saying to Ron ... what if someone 
had tried to intercept Hedwig? I mean, she’s never 
been hurt on a flight before, has she?” 

Page | 460Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Who’s the letter from anyway?” asked Ron, taking 
the note from Harry. 

“Snuffles,” said Harry quietly. 

“ ‘Same time, same place’? Does he mean the fire in 
the common room?” 

“Obviously,” said Hermione, also reading the note. 

She looked uneasy. “I just hope nobody else has read 
this...” 

“But it was still sealed and everything,” said Harry, 
trying to convince himself as much as her. “And 
nobody would understand what it meant if they didn’t 
know where we’d spoken to him before, would they?” 

“I don’t know,” said Hermione anxiously, hitching her 
bag back over her shoulder as the bell rang again. “It 
wouldn’t be exactly difficult to reseal the scroll by 
magic... And if anyone’s watching the Floo Network ... 
but I don’t really see how we can warn him not to 
come without that being intercepted too!” 

They trudged down the stone steps to the dungeons 
for Potions, all three of them lost in thought, but as 
they reached the bottom of the stairs they were 
recalled to themselves by the voice of Draco Malfoy, 
who was standing just outside Snape’s classroom 
door, waving around an official-looking piece of 
parchment and talking much louder than was 
necessary so that they could hear every word. 

“Yeah, Umbridge gave the Slytherin Quidditch team 
permission to continue playing straightaway, I went 
to ask her first thing this morning. Well, it was pretty 
much automatic, I mean, she knows my father really 
well, he’s always popping in and out of the Ministry... 



Page | 461Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




It’ll be interesting to see whether Gryffindor are 
allowed to keep playing, wont it?” 

“Don’t rise,” Hermione whispered imploringly to Harry 
and Ron, who were both watching Malfoy, faces set 
and fists clenched. “It’s what he wants...” 

“I mean,” said Malfoy, raising his voice a little more, 
his gray eyes glittering malevolently in Harry and 
Ron’s direction, “if it’s a question of influence with the 
Ministry, I don’t think they’ve got much chance... 

From what my father says, they’ve been looking for an 
excuse to sack Arthur Weasley for years... And as for 
Potter ... My father says it’s a matter of time before 
the Ministry has him carted off to St. Mungo’s... 
apparently they’ve got a special ward for people whose 
brains have been addled by magic...” 

Malfoy made a grotesque face, his mouth sagging 
open and his eyes rolling. Crabbe and Goyle gave 
their usual grunts of laughter, Pansy Parkinson 
shrieked with glee. 

Something collided hard with Harry’s shoulder, 
knocking him sideways. A split second later he 
realized that Neville had just charged past him, 
heading straight for Malfoy. 

“Neville, no!” 

Harry leapt forward and seized the back of Neville’s 
robes; Neville struggled frantically, his fists flailing, 
trying desperately to get at Malfoy who looked, for a 
moment, extremely shocked. 

“Help me!” Harry flung at Ron, managing to get an 
arm around Neville’s neck and dragging him 
backward, away from the Slytherins. Crabbe and 
Goyle were now flexing their arms, closing in front of 

Page | 462Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Malfoy, ready for the fight. Ron hurried forward and 
seized Neville’s arms; together, he and Harry 
succeeded in dragging Neville back into the Gryffindor 
line. Neville’s face was scarlet; the pressure Harry was 
exerting on his throat rendered him quite 
incomprehensible, but odd words spluttered from his 
mouth. 

“Not... funny ... don’t ... Mungo’s ... show ... him ...” 

The dungeon door opened. Snape appeared there. His 
black eyes swept up the Gryffindor line to the point 
where Harry and Ron were wrestling with Neville. 

“Fighting, Potter, Weasley, Longbottom?” Snape said 
in his cold, sneering voice. “Ten points from 
Gryffindor. Release Longbottom, Potter, or it will be 
detention. Inside, all of you.” 

Harry let go of Neville, who stood panting and glaring 
at him. 

“I had to stop you,” Harry gasped, picking up his bag. 
“Crabbe and Goyle would’ve torn you apart.” 

Neville said nothing, he merely snatched up his own 
bag and stalked off into the dungeon. 

“What in the name of Merlin,” said Ron slowly, as 
they followed Neville, “was that about?” 

Harry did not answer. He knew exactly why the 
subject of people who were in St. Mungo’s because of 
magical damage to their brains was highly distressing 
to Neville, but he had sworn to Dumbledore that he 
would not tell anyone Neville’s secret. Even Neville did 
not know that Harry knew. 



Page | 463Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Harry, Ron, and Hermione took their usual seats at 
the back of the class and pulled out parchment, 
quills, and their copies of One Thousand Magical 
Herbs and Fungi. The class around them was 
whispering about what Neville had just done, but 
when Snape closed the dungeon door with an echoing 
bang everybody fell silent immediately. 

“You will notice,” said Snape in his low, sneering 
voice, “that we have a guest with us today.” 

He gestured toward the dim corner of the dungeon, 
and Harry saw Professor Umbridge sitting there, 
clipboard on her knee. He glanced sideways at Ron 
and Hermione, his eyebrows raised. Snape and 
Umbridge, the two teachers he hated most ... it was 
hard to decide which he wanted to triumph over the 
other. 

“We are continuing with our Strengthening Solutions 
today, you will find your mixtures as you left them 
last lesson, if correctly made they should have 
matured well over the weekend — instructions” — he 
waved his wand again — “on the board. Carry on.” 

Professor Umbridge spent the first half hour of the 
lesson making notes in her corner. Harry was very 
interested in hearing her question Snape, so 
interested, that he was becoming careless with his 
potion again. 

“Salamander blood, Harry!” Hermione moaned, 
grabbing his wrist to prevent him adding the wrong 
ingredient for the third time. “Not pomegranate juice!” 

“Right,” said Harry vaguely, putting down the bottle 
and continuing to watch the corner. Umbridge had 
just gotten to her feet. “Ha,” he said softly, as she 



Page | 464Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




strode between two lines of desks toward Snape, who 
was bending over Dean Thomas’s cauldron. 

“Well, the class seems fairly advanced for their level,” 
she said briskly to Snape ’s back. “Though I would 
question whether it is advisable to teach them a 
potion like the Strengthening Solution. I think the 
Ministry would prefer it if that was removed from the 
syllabus.” 

Snape straightened up slowly and turned to look at 
her. 

“Now ... how long have you been teaching at 
Hogwarts?” she asked, her quill poised over her 
clipboard. 

“Fourteen years,” Snape replied. His expression was 
unfathomable. His eyes on Snape, Harry added a few 
drops to his potion; it hissed menacingly and turned 
from turquoise to orange. 

“You applied first for the Defense Against the Dark 
Arts post, I believe?” Professor Umbridge asked 
Snape. 

“Yes,” said Snape quietly. 

“But you were unsuccessful?” 

Snape ’s lip curled. 

“Obviously.” 

Professor Umbridge scribbled on her clipboard. 

“And you have applied regularly for the Defense 
Against the Dark Arts post since you first joined the 
school, I believe?” 

Page | 465Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Yes,” said Snape quietly, barely moving his lips. He 
looked very angry. 

“Do you have any idea why Dumbledore has 
consistently refused to appoint you?” asked 
Umbridge. 

“I suggest you ask him,” said Snape jerkily. 

“Oh I shall,” said Professor Umbridge with a sweet 
smile. 

“I suppose this is relevant?” Snape asked, his black 
eyes narrowed. 

“Oh yes,” said Professor Umbridge. “Yes, the Ministry 
wants a thorough understanding of teachers’ — er — 
backgrounds...” 

She turned away, walked over to Pansy Parkinson 
and began questioning her about the lessons. Snape 
looked around at Harry and their eyes met for a 
second. Harry hastily dropped his gaze to his potion, 
which was now congealing foully and giving off a 
strong smell of burned rubber. 

“No marks again, then, Potter,” said Snape 
maliciously, emptying Harry’s cauldron with a wave of 
his wand. “You will write me an essay on the correct 
composition of this potion, indicating how and why 
you went wrong, to be handed in next lesson, do you 
understand?” 

“Yes,” said Harry furiously. Snape had already given 
them homework, and he had Quidditch practice this 
evening; this would mean another couple of sleepless 
nights. It did not seem possible that he had awoken 
that morning feeling very happy. All he felt now was a 
fervent desire for this day to end as soon as possible. 
Page | 466Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Maybe I’ll skive off Divination,” he said glumly as 
they stood again in the courtyard after lunch, the 
wind whipping at the hems of robes and brims of 
hats. “I’ll pretend to be ill and do Snape’s essay 
instead, then I won’t have to stay up half the night...” 

“You can’t skive off Divination,” said Hermione 
severely. 

“Hark who’s talking, you walked out of Divination, 
you hate Trelawney!” said Ron indignantly. 

“I don’t hate her,” said Hermione loftily. “I just think 
she’s an absolutely appalling teacher and a real old 
fraud... But Harry’s already missed History of Magic 
and I don’t think he ought to miss anything else 
today!” 

There was too much truth in this to ignore, so half an 
hour later Harry took his seat in the hot, over- 
perfumed atmosphere of the Divination classroom 
feeling angry at everybody. Professor Trelawney was 
handing out copies of The Dream Oracle yet again; he 
would surely be much better employed doing Snape’s 
punishment essay than sitting here trying to find 
meaning in a lot of made-up dreams. 

It seemed, however, that he was not the only person 
in Divination who was in a temper. Professor 
Trelawney slammed a copy of the Oracle down on the 
table between Harry and Ron and swept away, her 
lips pursed; she threw the next copy of the Oracle at 
Seamus and Dean, narrowly avoiding Seamus’s head, 
and thrust the final one into Neville’s chest with such 
force that he slipped off his pouf. 

“Well, carry on!” said Professor Trelawney loudly, her 
voice high pitched and somewhat hysterical. “You 



Page | 467Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




know what to do! Or am I such a substandard teacher 
that you have never learned how to open a book?” 

The class stared perplexedly at her and then at each 
other. Harry, however, thought he knew what was the 
matter. As Professor Trelawney flounced back to the 
high-backed teacher’s chair, her magnified eyes full of 
angry tears, he leaned his head closer to Ron’s and 
muttered, “I think she’s got the results of her 
inspection back.” 

“Professor?” said Parvati Patil in a hushed voice (she 
and Lavender had always rather admired Professor 
Trelawney). “Professor, is there anything — er — 
wrong?” 

“Wrong!” cried Professor Trelawney in a voice 
throbbing with emotion. “Certainly not! I have been 
insulted, certainly... Insinuations have been made 
against me... Unfounded accusations levelled ... but 
no, there is nothing wrong, certainly not...” 

She took a great shuddering breath and looked away 
from Parvati, angry tears spilling from under her 
glasses. 

“I say nothing,” she choked, “of sixteen years’ devoted 
service... It has passed, apparently, unnoticed... But I 
shall not be insulted, no, I shall not!” 

“But Professor, who’s insulting you?” asked Parvati 
timidly. 

“The establishment!” said Professor Trelawney in a 
deep, dramatic, wavering voice. “Yes, those with eyes 
too clouded by the Mundane to See as I See, to Know 
as I Know ... Of course, we Seers have always been 
feared, always persecuted... It is — alas — our fate...” 



Page | 468Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




She gulped, dabbed at her wet cheeks with the end of 
her shawl, and then pulled a small, embroidered 
handkerchief from her sleeve, into which she blew her 
nose very hard with a sound like Peeves blowing a 
raspberry. Ron sniggered. Lavender shot him a 
disgusted look. 

“Professor,” said Parvati, “do you mean ... is it 
something Professor Umbridge ... ?” 

“Do not speak to me about that woman!” cried 
Professor Trelawney, leaping to her feet, her beads 
rattling and her spectacles flashing. “Kindly continue 
with your work!” 

And she spent the rest of the lesson striding among 
them, tears still leaking from behind her glasses, 
muttering what sounded like threats under her 
breath. 

"... may well choose to leave ... the indignity of it ... on 
probation ... we shall see ... how she dares ...” 

“You and Umbridge have got something in common,” 
Harry told Hermione quietly when they met again in 
Defense Against the Dark Arts. “She obviously 
reckons Trelawney’s an old fraud too... Looks like 
she’s put her on probation.” 

Umbridge entered the room as he spoke, wearing her 
black velvet bow and an expression of great 
smugness. 

“Good afternoon, class.” 

“Good afternoon, Professor Umbridge,” they chanted 
drearily. 

“Wands away, please ...” 

Page | 469Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




But there was no answering flurry of movement this 
time; nobody had bothered to take out their wands. 

“Please turn to page thirty-four of Defensive Magical 
Theory and read the third chapter, entitled The Case 
for Non-Offensive Responses to Magical Attack.’ There 
will be — ” 

“ — no need to talk,” Harry, Ron, and Hermione said 
together under their breaths. 

“No Quidditch practice,” said Angelina in hollow tones 
when Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered the common 
room that night after dinner. 

“But I kept my temper!” said Harry, horrified. “I didn’t 
say anything to her, Angelina, I swear, I — ” 

“I know, I know,” said Angelina miserably. “She just 
said she needed a bit of time to consider.” 

“Consider what?” said Ron angrily. “She’s given the 
Slytherins permission, why not us?” 

But Harry could imagine how much Umbridge was 
enjoying holding the threat of no Gryffindor Quidditch 
team over their heads and could easily understand 
why she would not want to relinquish that weapon 
over them too soon. 

“Well,” said Hermione, “look on the bright side — at 
least now you’ll have time to do Snape’s essay!” 

“That’s a bright side, is it?” snapped Harry, while Ron 
stared incredulously at Hermione. “No Quidditch 
practice and extra Potions?” 

Harry slumped down into a chair, dragged his Potions 
essay reluctantly from his bag, and set to work.

It was very hard to concentrate; even though he knew 
that Sirius was not due in the fire until much later he 
could not help glancing into the flames every few 
minutes just in case. There was also an incredible 
amount of noise in the room: Fred and George 
appeared finally to have perfected one type of Skiving 
Snackbox, which they were taking turns to 
demonstrate to a cheering and whooping crowd. 

First, Fred would take a bite out of the orange end of 
a chew, at which he would vomit spectacularly into a 
bucket they had placed in front of them. Then he 
would force down the purple end of the chew, at 
which the vomiting would immediately cease. Lee 
Jordan, who was assisting the demonstration, was 
lazily vanishing the vomit at regular intervals with the 
same Vanishing Spell Snape kept using on Harry’s 
potions. 

What with the regular sounds of retching, cheering, 
and Fred and George taking advance orders from the 
crowd, Harry was finding it exceptionally difficult to 
focus on the correct method for Strengthening 
Solutions. Hermione was not helping matters; the 
cheers and sound of vomit hitting the bottom of Fred 
and George’s bucket were punctuated by loud and 
disapproving sniffs that Harry found, if anything, 
more distracting. 

“Just go and stop them, then!” he said irritably, after 
crossing out the wrong weight of powdered griffin 
claw for the fourth time. 

“I can’t, they’re not technically doing anything wrong,” 
said Hermione through gritted teeth. “They’re quite 
within their rights to eat the foul things themselves, 
and I can’t find a rule that says the other idiots aren’t 
entitled to buy them, not unless they’re proven to be 



Page | 471Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




dangerous in some way, and it doesn’t look as though 
they are...” 

She, Harry, and Ron watched George projectile-vomit 
into the bucket, gulp down the rest of the chew, and 
straighten up, beaming with his arms wide to 
protracted applause. 

“You know, I don’t get why Fred and George only got 
three O.W.L.s each,” said Harry, watching as Fred, 
George, and Lee collected gold from the eager crowd. 
“They really know their stuff...” 

“Oh, they only know flashy stuff that’s no real use to 
anyone,” said Hermione disparagingly. 

“No real use?” said Ron in a strained voice. 

“Hermione, they’ve got about twenty-six Galleons 
already...” 

It was a long while before the crowd around the 
Weasleys dispersed, and then Fred, Lee, and George 
sat up counting their takings even longer, so that it 
was well past midnight when Harry, Ron, and 
Hermione finally had the common room to themselves 
again. At long last, Fred closed the doorway to the 
boys’ dormitories behind him, rattling his box of 
Galleons ostentatiously so that Hermione scowled. 
Harry, who was making very little progress with his 
Potions essay, decided to give it up for the night. As 
he put his books away, Ron, who was dozing lightly in 
an armchair, gave a muffled grunt, awoke, looked 
blearily into the fire and said, “Sirius!” 

Harry whipped around; Sirius’s untidy dark head was 
sitting in the fire again. 

“Hi,” he said, grinning. 



Page | 472Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Hi,” chorused Harry, Ron, and Hermione, all three 
kneeling down upon the hearthrug. Crookshanks 
purred loudly and approached the fire, trying, despite 
the heat, to put his face close to Sirius’s. 

“How’re things?” said Sirius. 

“Not that good,” said Harry, as Hermione pulled 
Crookshanks back to stop him singeing his whiskers. 
“The Ministry’s forced through another decree, which 
means we’re not allowed to have Quidditch teams — ” 

“ — or secret Defense Against the Dark Arts groups?” 
said Sirius. 

There was a short pause. 

“How did you know about that?” Harry demanded. 

“You want to choose your meeting places more 
carefully,” said Sirius, grinning still more broadly. 
“The Hog’s Head, I ask you ...” 

“Well, it was better than the Three Broomsticks!” said 
Hermione defensively. “That’s always packed with 
people — ” 

“ — which means you’d have been harder to overhear,” 
said Sirius. “You’ve got a lot to learn, Hermione.” 

“Who overheard us?” Harry demanded. 

“Mundungus, of course,” said Sirius, and when they 
all looked puzzled he laughed. “He was the witch 
under the veil.” 

“That was Mundungus?” Harry said, stunned. “What 
was he doing in the Hog’s Head?” 



Page | 473Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“What do you think he was doing?” said Sirius 
impatiently. “Keeping an eye on you, of course.” 

“I’m still being followed?” asked Harry angrily. 

“Yeah, you are,” said Sirius, “and just as well, isn’t it, 
if the first thing you’re going to do on your weekend 
off is organize an illegal defense group.” 

But he looked neither angry nor worried; on the 
contrary, he was looking at Harry with distinct pride. 

“Why was Dung hiding from us?” asked Ron, 
sounding disappointed. “We’d’ve liked to’ve seen him.” 

“He was banned from the Hog’s Head twenty years 
ago,” said Sirius, “and that barman’s got a long 
memory. We lost Moody’s spare Invisibility Cloak 
when Sturgis was arrested, so Dung’s been dressing 
as a witch a lot lately... Anyway ... First of all, Ron — 
I’ve sworn to pass on a message from your mother.” 

“Oh yeah?” said Ron, sounding apprehensive. 

“She says on no account whatsoever are you to take 
part in an illegal secret Defense Against the Dark Arts 
group. She says you’ll be expelled for sure and your 
future will be ruined. She says there will be plenty of 
time to learn how to defend yourself later and that 
you are too young to be worrying about that right 
now. She also” — Sirius’s eyes turned to the other two 
— “advises Harry and Hermione not to proceed with 
the group, though she accepts that she has no 
authority over either of them and simply begs them to 
remember that she has their best interests at heart. 
She would have written all this to you, but if the owl 
had been intercepted you’d all have been in real 
trouble, and she can’t say it for herself because she’s 
on duty tonight.” 

Page | 474Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“On duty doing what?” said Ron quickly. 

“Never you mind, just stuff for the Order,” said Sirius. 
“So it’s fallen to me to be the messenger and make 
sure you tell her I passed it all on, because I don’t 
think she trusts me to.” 

There was another pause in which Crookshanks, 
mewing, attempted to paw Sirius’s head, and Ron 
fiddled with a hole in the hearthrug. 

“So you want me to say I’m not going to take part in 
the defense group?” he muttered finally. 

“Me? Certainly not!” said Sirius, looking surprised. “I 
think it’s an excellent idea!” 

“You do?” said Harry, his heart lifting. 

“Of course I do!” said Sirius. “D’you think your father 
and I would’ve lain down and taken orders from an 
old hag like Umbridge?” 

“But — last term all you did was tell me to be careful 
and not take risks — ” 

“Last year all the evidence was that someone inside 
Hogwarts was trying to kill you, Harry!” said Sirius 
impatiently. “This year we know that there’s someone 
outside Hogwarts who’d like to kill us all, so I think 
learning to defend yourselves properly is a very good 
idea!” 

“And if we do get expelled?” Hermione asked, a 
quizzical look on her face. 

“Hermione, this whole thing was your idea!” said 
Harry, staring at her. 



Page | 475Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“I know it was... I just wondered what Sirius 
thought,” she said, shrugging. 

“Well, better expelled and able to defend yourselves 
than sitting safely in school without a clue,” said 
Sirius. 

“Hear, hear,” said Harry and Ron enthusiastically. 

“So,” said Sirius, “how are you organizing this group? 
Where are you meeting?” 

“Well, that’s a bit of a problem now,” said Harry. 
“Dunno where we’re going to be able to go...” 

“How about the Shrieking Shack?” suggested Sirius. 

“Hey, that’s an idea!” said Ron excitedly, but 
Hermione made a skeptical noise and all three of 
them looked at her, Sirius’s head turning in the 
flames. 

“Well, Sirius, it’s just that there were only four of you 
meeting in the Shrieking Shack when you were at 
school,” said Hermione, “and all of you could 
transform into animals and I suppose you could all 
have squeezed under a single Invisibility Cloak if 
you’d wanted to. But there are twenty-eight of us and 
none of us is an Animagus, so we wouldn’t need so 
much an Invisibility Cloak as an Invisibility Marquee 



“Fair point,” said Sirius, looking slightly crestfallen. 
“Well, I’m sure you’ll come up with somewhere... 
There used to be a pretty roomy secret passageway 
behind that big mirror on the fourth floor, you might 
have enough space to practice jinxes in there — ” 



Page | 476Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Fred and George told me it’s blocked,” said Harry, 
shaking his head. “Caved in or something.” 

“Oh ...” said Sirius, frowning. “Well, 111 have a think 
and get back to — ” 

He broke off. His face was suddenly tense, alarmed. 
He turned sideways, apparently looking into the solid 
brick wall of the fireplace. 

“Sirius?” said Harry anxiously. 

But he had vanished. Harry gaped at the flames for a 
moment, then turned to look at Ron and Hermione. 

“Why did he — ?” 

Hermione gave a horrified gasp and leapt to her feet, 
still staring at the fire. 

A hand had appeared amongst the flames, groping as 
though to catch hold of something; a stubby, short- 
fingered hand covered in ugly old-fashioned rings... 

The three of them ran for it; at the door of the boys’ 
dormitory Harry looked back. Umbridge’s hand was 
still making snatching movements amongst the 
flames, as though she knew exactly where Sirius’s 
hair had been moments before and was determined to 
seize it.

DUMBLEDORE’S ARMY 

“Umbridge has been reading your mail, Harry. There’s 
no other explanation.” 

“You think Umbridge attacked Hedwig?” he said, 
outraged. 

“I’m almost certain of it,” said Hermione grimly. 

“Watch your frog, it’s escaping.” 

Harry pointed his wand at the bullfrog that had been 
hopping hopefully toward the other side of the table 
— “Acciol ” — and it zoomed gloomily back into his 
hand. 

Charms was always one of the best lessons in which 
to enjoy a private chat: There was generally so much 
movement and activity that the danger of being 
overheard was very slight. Today, with the room full of 
croaking bullfrogs and cawing ravens, and with a 
heavy downpour of rain clattering and pounding 
against the classroom windows, Harry, Ron, and 
Hermione ’s whispered discussion about how 
Page | 478Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 



Umbridge had nearly caught Sirius went quite 
unnoticed. 

“I’ve been suspecting this ever since Filch accused 
you of ordering Dungbombs, because it seemed such 
a stupid lie,” Hermione whispered. “I mean, once your 
letter had been read, it would have been quite clear 
you weren’t ordering them, so you wouldn’t have been 
in trouble at all — it’s a bit of a feeble joke, isn’t it? 
But then I thought, what if somebody just wanted an 
excuse to read your mail? Well then, it would be a 
perfect way for Umbridge to manage it — tip off Filch, 
let him do the dirty work and confiscate the letter, 
then either find a way of stealing it from him or else 
demand to see it — I don’t think Filch would object, 
when’s he ever stuck up for a student’s rights? Harry, 
you’re squashing your frog.” 

Harry looked down; he was indeed squeezing his 
bullfrog so tightly its eyes were popping; he replaced 
it hastily upon the desk. 

“It was a very, very close call last night,” said 
Hermione. “I just wonder if Umbridge knows how 
close it was. Silenciol” 

The bullfrog on which she was practicing her 
Silencing Charm was struck dumb mid-croak and 
glared at her reproachfully. 

“If she’d caught Snuffles ...” 

Harry finished the sentence for her. 

“He’d probably be back in Azkaban this morning.” He 
waved his wand without really concentrating; his 
bullfrog swelled like a green balloon and emitted a 
high-pitched whistle. 



Page | 479Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Silenciol” said Hermione hastily, pointing her wand 
at Harry’s frog, which deflated silently before them. 
“Well, he mustn’t do it again, that’s all. I just don’t 
know how we’re going to let him know. We can’t send 
him an owl.” 

“I don’t reckon he’ll risk it again,” said Ron. “He’s not 
stupid, he knows she nearly got him. Silenciol” 

The large and ugly raven in front of him let out a 
derisive caw. 

“ Silenciol SILENCIO” 

The raven cawed more loudly. 

“It’s the way you’re moving your wand,” said 
Hermione, watching Ron critically. “You don’t want to 
wave it, it’s more a sharp jab.” 

“Ravens are harder than frogs,” said Ron testily. 

“Fine, let’s swap,” said Hermione, seizing Ron’s raven 
and replacing it with her own fat bullfrog. “Silencio\” 
The raven continued to open and close its sharp beak, 
but no sound came out. 

“Very good, Miss Granger!” said Professor Flitwick’s 
squeaky little voice and Harry, Ron, and Hermione all 
jumped. “Now, let me see you try, Mr. Weasley!” 

“Wha — ? Oh — oh, right,” said Ron, very flustered. 
“Er — Silenciol” 

He jabbed at the bullfrog so hard that he poked it in 
the eye; the frog gave a deafening croak and leapt off 
the desk. 



Page | 480Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




It came as no surprise to any of them that Harry and 
Ron were given additional practice of the Silencing 
Charm for homework. 

They were allowed to remain inside over break due to 
the downpour outside. They found seats in a noisy 
and overcrowded classroom on the first floor in which 
Peeves was floating dreamily up near the chandelier, 
occasionally blowing an ink pellet at the top of 
somebody’s head. They had barely sat down when 
Angelina came struggling toward them through the 
groups of gossiping students. 

“I’ve got permission!” she said. “To re-form the 
Quidditch team!” 

“Excellent.” said Ron and Harry together. 

“Yeah,” said Angelina, beaming. “I went to 
McGonagall and I think she might have appealed to 
Dumbledore — anyway, Umbridge had to give in. Ha! 
So I want you down at the pitch at seven o’clock 
tonight, all right, because we’ve got to make up time, 
you realize we’re only three weeks away from our first 
match?” 

She squeezed away from them, narrowly dodged an 
ink pellet from Peeves, which hit a nearby first year 
instead, and vanished from sight. 

Ron’s smile slipped slightly as he looked out of the 
window, which was now opaque with hammering 
rain. 

“Hope this clears up ... What’s up with you, 
Hermione?” 



Page | 481Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




She too was gazing at the window, but not as though 
she really saw it. Her eyes were unfocused and there 
was a frown on her face. 

“Just thinking ...” she said, still frowning at the rain- 
washed window. 

“About Siri . . . Snuffles?” said Harry. 

“No ... not exactly ...” said Hermione slowly. “More ... 
wondering ... I suppose we’re doing the right thing ... 

I think ... aren’t we? 

Harry and Ron looked at each other. 

“Well, that clears that up,” said Ron. “It would’ve been 
really annoying if you hadn’t explained yourself 
properly.” 

Hermione looked at him as though she had only just 
realized he was there. 

“I was just wondering,” she said, her voice stronger 
now, “whether we’re doing the right thing, starting 
this Defense Against the Dark Arts group.” 

“What!” said Harry and Ron together. 

“Hermione, it was your idea in the first place!” said 
Ron indignantly. 

“I know,” said Hermione, twisting her fingers together. 
“But after talking to Snuffles ...” 

“But he’s all for it!” said Harry. 

“Yes,” said Hermione, staring at the window again. 
“Yes, that’s what made me think maybe it wasn’t a 
good idea after all...” 

Page | 482Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Peeves floated over them on his stomach, peashooter 
at the ready; automatically all three of them lifted 
their bags to cover their heads until he had passed. 

“Let’s get this straight,” said Harry angrily, as they 
put their bags back on the floor, “Sirius agrees with 
us, so you don’t think we should do it anymore?” 

Hermione looked tense and rather miserable. Now 
staring at her own hands she said, “Do you honestly 
trust his judgment?” 

“Yes, I do!” said Harry at once. “He’s always given us 
great advice!” 

An ink pellet whizzed past them, striking Katie Bell 
squarely in the ear. Hermione watched Katie leap to 
her feet and start throwing things at Peeves; it was a 
few moments before Hermione spoke again and it 
sounded as though she was choosing her words very 
carefully. 

“You don’t think he has become ... sort of ... reckless 
... since he’s been cooped up in Grimmauld Place? 

You don’t think he’s ... kind of ... living through us?” 

“What d’you mean, ‘living through us’?” Harry 
retorted. 

“I mean ... well, I think he’d love to be forming secret 
defense societies right under the nose of someone 
from the Ministry... I think he’s really frustrated at 
how little he can do where he is ... so I think he’s 
keen to kind of ... egg us on.” 

Ron looked utterly perplexed. 

“Sirius is right,” he said, “you do sound just like my 
mother.” 

Page | 483Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Hermione bit her lip and did not answer. The bell 
rang just as Peeves swooped down upon Katie and 
emptied an entire ink bottle over her head. 

The weather did not improve as the day wore on, so 
that at seven o’clock that evening, when Harry and 
Ron went down to the Quidditch pitch for practice, 
they were soaked through within minutes, their feet 
slipping and sliding on the sodden grass. The sky was 
a deep, thundery gray and it was a relief to gain the 
warmth and light of the changing rooms, even if they 
knew the respite was only temporary. They found 
Fred and George debating whether to use one of their 
own Skiving Snackboxes to get out of flying. 

“ — but I bet she’d know what we’d done,” Fred said 
out of the corner of his mouth. “If only I hadn’t offered 
to sell her some Puking Pastilles yesterday — ” 

“We could try the Fever Fudge,” George muttered, “no 
one’s seen that yet — ” 

“Does it work?” inquired Ron hopefully, as the 
hammering of rain on the roof intensified and wind 
howled around the building. 

“Well, yeah,” said Fred, “your temperature’ll go right 
up — ” 



“ — but you get these massive pus-filled boils too,” 
said George, “and we haven’t worked out how to get 
rid of them yet.” 

“I can’t see any boils,” said Ron, staring at the twins. 

“No, well, you wouldn’t,” said Fred darkly, “they’re not 
in a place we generally display to the public — ” 



Page | 484Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“ — but they make sitting on a broom a right pain in 
the — ” 



“All right, everyone, listen up,” said Angelina loudly, 
emerging from the Captain’s office. “I know it’s not 
ideal weather, but there’s a good chance we’ll be 
playing Slytherin in conditions like this so it’s a good 
idea to work out how we’re going to cope with them. 
Harry, didn’t you do something to your glasses to stop 
the rain fogging them up when we played Hufflepuff 
in that storm?” 

“Hermione did it,” said Harry. He pulled out his wand, 
tapped his glasses and said, “Imperviusl” 

“I think we all ought to try that,” said Angelina. “If we 
could just keep the rain off our faces it would really 
help visibility — all together, come on — Imperviusl 
Okay. Let’s go.” 

They all stowed their wands back in the inside 
pockets of their robes, shouldered their brooms, and 
followed Angelina out of the changing rooms. 

They squelched through the deepening mud to the 
middle of the pitch; visibility was still very poor even 
with the Impervius Charm; light was fading fast and 
curtains of rain were sweeping the grounds. 

“All right, on my whistle,” shouted Angelina. 

Harry kicked off from the ground, spraying mud in all 
directions, and shot upward, the wind pulling him 
slightly off course. He had no idea how he was going 
to see the Snitch in this weather; he was having 
enough difficulty seeing the one Bludger with which 
they were practicing; a minute into the practice it 
almost unseated him and he had to use the Sloth 
Grip Roll to avoid it. Unfortunately Angelina did not 
Page | 485Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




see this; in fact, she did not appear to be able to see 
anything; none of them had a clue what the others 
were doing. The wind was picking up; even at a 
distance Harry could hear the swishing, pounding 
sounds of the rain pummeling the surface of the lake. 

Angelina kept them at it for nearly an hour before 
conceding defeat. She led her sodden and disgruntled 
team back into the changing rooms, insisting that the 
practice had not been a waste of time, though without 
any real conviction in her voice. Fred and George were 
looking particularly annoyed; both were bandy-legged 
and winced with every movement. Harry could hear 
them complaining in low voices as he toweled his hair 
dry. 

“I think a few of mine have ruptured,” said Fred in a 
hollow voice. 

“Mine haven’t,” said George, wincing. “They’re 
throbbing like mad ... feel bigger if anything ...” 

“OUCH!” said Harry. 

He pressed the towel to his face, his eyes screwed 
tight with pain. The scar on his forehead had seared 
again, more painfully than in months. 

“What’s up?” said several voices. 

Harry emerged from behind his towel; the changing 
room was blurred because he was not wearing his 
glasses; but he could still tell that everyone’s face was 
turned toward him. 

“Nothing,” he muttered, “I — poked myself in the eye, 
that’s all...” 



Page | 486Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




But he gave Ron a significant look and the two of 
them hung back as the rest of the team filed back 
outside, muffled in their cloaks, their hats pulled low 
over their ears. 

“What happened?” said Ron, the moment that Alicia 
had disappeared through the door. “Was it your 
scar?” 

Harry nodded. 

“But ...” Looking scared, Ron strode across to the 
window and stared out into the rain, “He — he can’t 
be near us now, can he?” 

“No,” Harry muttered, sinking onto a bench and 
rubbing his forehead. “He’s probably miles away. It 
hurt because ... he’s ... angry.” 

Harry had not meant to say that at all, and heard the 
words as though a stranger had spoken them — yet 
he knew at once that they were true. He did not know 
how he knew it, but he did; Voldemort, wherever he 
was, whatever he was doing, was in a towering 
temper. 

“Did you see him?” said Ron, looking horrified. “Did 
you . . . get a vision, or something?” 

Harry sat quite still, staring at his feet, allowing his 
mind and his memory to relax in the aftermath of the 
pain... 

A confused tangle of shapes, a howling rush of voices 



“He wants something done, and it’s not happening 
fast enough,” he said. 



Page | 487Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Again, he felt surprised to hear the words coming out 
of his mouth, and yet quite certain that they were 
true. 

“But ... how do you know?” said Ron. 

Harry shook his head and covered his eyes with his 
hands, pressing down upon them with his palms. 
Little stars erupted in them. He felt Ron sit down on 
the bench beside him and knew Ron was staring at 
him. 

“Is this what it was about last time?” said Ron in a 
hushed voice. “When your scar hurt in Umbridge’s 
office? You-Know-Who was angry?” 

Harry shook his head. 

“What is it, then?” 

Harry was thinking himself back. He had been 
looking into Umbridge’s face... His scar had hurt ... 
and he had had that odd feeling in his stomach ... a 
strange, leaping feeling ... a happy feeling... But, of 
course, he had not recognized it for what it was, as he 
had been feeling so miserable himself. . . 

“Last time, it was because he was pleased,” he said. 
“Really pleased. 

“He thought ... something good was going to happen. 
And the night before we came back to Hogwarts ...” 

He thought back to the moment when his scar had 
hurt so badly in his and Ron’s bedroom in 
Grimmauld Place. “He was furious...” 

He looked around at Ron, who was gaping at him. 



Page | 488Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“You could take over from Trelawney, mate,” he said 
in an awed voice. 

“I’m not making prophecies,” said Harry. 

“No, you know what you’re doing?” Ron said, 
sounding both scared and impressed. “Harry, you’re 
reading You-Know-Who’s mind...” 

“No,” said Harry, shaking his head. “It’s more like ... 
his mood, I suppose. I’m just getting flashes of what 
mood he’s in... Dumbledore said something like this 
was happening last year. . . He said that when 
Voldemort was near me, or when he was feeling 
hatred, I could tell. Well, now I’m feeling it when he’s 
pleased too...” 

There was a pause. The wind and rain lashed at the 
building. 

“You’ve got to tell someone,” said Ron. 

“I told Sirius last time.” 

“Well, tell him about this time!” 

“Can’t, can I?” said Harry grimly. “Umbridge is 
watching the owls and the fires, remember?” 

“Well then, Dumbledore — ” 

“I’ve just told you, he already knows,” said Harry 
shortly, getting to his feet, taking his cloak off his peg, 
and swinging it around himself. “There’s no point 
telling him again.” 

Ron did up the fastening of his own cloak, watching 
Harry thoughtfully. 



Page | 489Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Dumbledore’d want to know,” he said. 



Harry shrugged. 

“C’mon ... we’ve still got Silencing Charms to practice 



They hurried back through the dark grounds, sliding 
and stumbling up the muddy lawns, not talking. 

Harry was thinking hard. What was it that Voldemort 
wanted done that was not happening quickly enough? 

“He’s got other plans ... plans he can put into operation 
very quietly indeed . . . stuff he can only get by stealth 
... like a weapon. Something he didn’t have last time.” 

He had not thought about those words in weeks; he 
had been too absorbed in what was going on at 
Hogwarts, too busy dwelling on the ongoing battles 
with Umbridge, the injustice of all the Ministry 
interference... But now they came back to him and 
made him wonder... Voldemort’s anger would make 
sense if he was no nearer laying hands on the 
weapon, whatever it was... Had the Order thwarted 
him, stopped him from seizing it? Where was it kept? 
Who had it now? 

“Mimbulus mimbletonia,” said Ron’s voice and Harry 
came back to his senses just in time to clamber 
through the portrait hole into the common room. 

It appeared that Hermione had gone to bed early, 
leaving Crookshanks curled in a nearby chair and an 
assortment of knobbly, knitted elf hats lying on a 
table by the fire. Harry was rather grateful that she 
was not around because he did not much want to 
discuss his scar hurting and have her urge him to go 
to Dumbledore too. Ron kept throwing him anxious 
glances, but Harry pulled out his Potions book and 
Page | 490Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




set to work to finish his essay, though he was only 
pretending to concentrate and, by the time that Ron 
said he was going to bed too, had written hardly 
anything. 

Midnight came and went while Harry was reading and 
rereading a passage about the uses of scurvy-grass, 
lovage, and sneezewort and not taking in a word of 
it... 

These plantes are moste efficacious in the inflaming 
of the braine, and are therefore much used in 
Confusing and Befuddlement Draughts, where the 
wizard is desirous of producing hot-headedness and 
recklessness... 

... Hermione said Sirius was becoming reckless 
cooped up in Grimmauld Place... 

. . . moste efficacious in the inflaming of the braine, and 
are therefore much used . . . 

. . . the Daily Prophet would think his brain was 
inflamed if they found out that he knew what 
Voldemort was feeling ... 

. . . therefore much used in Confusing and 
Befuddlement Draughts . . . 

. . . confusing was the word, all right; why did he know 
what Voldemort was feeling? What was this weird 
connection between them, which Dumbledore had 
never been able to explain satisfactorily? 

. . . where the wizard is desirous . . . 

. . . how he would like to sleep . . . 

...of producing hot-headedness . . .

... It was warm and comfortable in his armchair 
before the fire, with the rain still beating heavily on 
the windowpanes and Crookshanks purring and the 
crackling of the flames... 

The book slipped from Harry’s slack grip and landed 
with a dull thud on the hearthrug. His head fell 
sideways... 

He was walking once more along a windowless 
corridor, his footsteps echoing in the silence. As the 
door at the end of the passage loomed larger his heart 
beat fast with excitement... If he could only open it ... 
enter beyond . . . 

He stretched out his hand... His fingertips were 
inches from it... 

“Harry Potter, sir!” 

He awoke with a start. The candles had all been 
extinguished in the common room, but there was 
something moving close by. 

“Whozair?” said Harry, sitting upright in his chair. 

The fire was almost extinguished, the room very dark. 

“Dobby has your owl, sir!” said a squeaky voice. 

“Dobby?” said Harry thickly, peering through the 
gloom toward the source of the voice. 

Dobby the house-elf was standing beside the table on 
which Hermione had left her half a dozen knitted 
hats. His large, pointed ears were now sticking out 
from beneath what looked like all the hats that 
Hermione had ever knitted; he was wearing one on 
top of the other, so that his head seemed elongated by 



Page | 492Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




two or three feet, and on the very topmost bobble sat 
Hedwig, hooting serenely and obviously cured. 



“Dobby volunteered to return Harry Potter’s owl!” said 
the elf squeakily, with a look of positive adoration on 
his face. “Professor Grubbly-Plank says she is all well 
now, sir!” 

He sank into a deep bow so that his pencil-like nose 
brushed the threadbare surface of the hearthrug and 
Hedwig gave an indignant hoot and fluttered onto the 
arm of Harry’s chair. 

“Thanks, Dobby!” said Harry, stroking Hedwig’s head 
and blinking hard, trying to rid himself of the image 
of the door in his dream... It had been very vivid... 
Looking back at Dobby, he noticed that the elf was 
also wearing several scarves and innumerable socks, 
so that his feet looked far too big for his body. 

“Er . . . have you been taking all the clothes 
Hermione’s been leaving out?” 

“Oh no, sir,” said Dobby happily, “Dobby has been 
taking some for Winky too, sir.” 

“Yeah, how is Winky?” asked Harry. 

Dobby’s ears drooped slightly. 

“Winky is still drinking lots, sir,” he said sadly, his 
enormous round green eyes, large as tennis balls, 
downcast. “She still does not care for clothes, Harry 
Potter. Nor do the other house-elves. None of them 
will clean Gryffindor Tower anymore, not with the 
hats and socks hidden everywhere, they finds them 
insulting, sir. Dobby does it all himself, sir, but 
Dobby does not mind, sir, for he always hopes to meet 
Harry Potter and tonight, sir, he has got his wish!” 
Page | 493Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Dobby sank into a deep bow again. “But Harry Potter 
does not seem happy,” Dobby went on, straightening 
up again and looking timidly at Harry. “Dobby heard 
him muttering in his sleep. Was Harry Potter having 
bad dreams?” 

“Not really bad,” said Harry, yawning and rubbing his 
eyes. “I’ve had worse.” 

The elf surveyed Harry out of his vast, orblike eyes. 
Then he said very seriously, his ears drooping, 

“Dobby wishes he could help Harry Potter, for Harry 
Potter set Dobby free and Dobby is much, much 
happier now...” 

Harry smiled. 

“You can’t help me, Dobby, but thanks for the offer...” 

He bent and picked up his Potions book. He’d have to 
try and finish the essay tomorrow. He closed the book 
and as he did so the firelight illuminated the thin 
white scars on the back of his hand — the result of 
his detention with Umbridge. 

“Wait a moment — there is something you can do for 
me, Dobby,” said Harry slowly. 

The elf looked around, beaming. 

“Name it, Harry Potter, sir!” 

“I need to find a place where twenty-eight people can 
practice Defense Against the Dark Arts without being 
discovered by any of the teachers. Especially,” Harry 
clenched his hand on the book, so that the scars 
shone pearly white, “Professor Umbridge.” 



Page | 494Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




He expected the elf’s smile to vanish, his ears to 
droop; he expected him to say that this was 
impossible, or else that he would try, but his hopes 
were not high... What he had not expected was for 
Dobby to give a little skip, his ears waggling happily, 
and clap his hands together. 

“Dobby knows the perfect place, sir!” he said happily. 
“Dobby heard tell of it from the other house-elves 
when he came to Hogwarts, sir. It is known by us as 
the Come and Go Room, sir, or else as the Room of 
Requirement!” 

“Why?” said Harry curiously. 

“Because it is a room that a person can only enter,” 
said Dobby seriously, “when they have real need of it. 
Sometimes it is there, and sometimes it is not, but 
when it appears, it is always equipped for the seeker’s 
needs. Dobby has used it, sir,” said the elf, dropping 
his voice and looking guilty, “when Winky has been 
very drunk. He has hidden her in the Room of 
Requirement and he has found antidotes to 
butterbeer there, and a nice elf-sized bed to settle her 
on while she sleeps it off, sir... And Dobby knows Mr. 
Filch has found extra cleaning materials there when 
he has run short, sir, and — ” 

“ — and if you really needed a bathroom,” said Harry, 
suddenly remembering something Dumbledore had 
said at the Yule Ball the previous Christmas, “would 
it fill itself with chamber pots?” 

“Dobby expects so, sir,” said Dobby, nodding 
earnestly. “It is a most amazing room, sir.” 

“How many people know about it?” said Harry, sitting 
up straighter in his chair. 



Page | 495Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Very few, sir. Mostly people stumbles across it when 
they needs it, sir, but often they never finds it again, 
for they do not know that it is always there waiting to 
be called into service, sir.” 

“It sounds brilliant,” said Harry, his heart racing. “It 
sounds perfect, Dobby. When can you show me where 
it is?” 



“Anytime, Harry Potter, sir,” said Dobby, looking 
delighted at Harry’s enthusiasm. “We could go now, if 
you like!” 

For a moment Harry was tempted to go now; he was 
halfway out of his seat, intending to hurry upstairs 
for his Invisibility Cloak when, not for the first time, a 
voice very much like Hermione’s whispered in his ear: 
reckless. It was, after all, very late, he was exhausted 
and had Snape’s essay to finish. 

“Not tonight, Dobby,” said Harry reluctantly, sinking 
back into his chair. “This is really important... I don’t 
want to blow it, it’ll need proper planning... Listen, 
can you just tell me exactly where this Room of 
Requirement is and how to get in there?” 

Their robes billowed and swirled around them as they 
splashed across the flooded vegetable patch to double 
Herbology, where they could hardly hear what 
Professor Sprout was saying over the hammering of 
raindrops hard as hailstones on the greenhouse roof. 
The afternoon’s Care of Magical Creatures lesson was 
to be relocated from the storm-swept grounds to a 
free classroom on the ground floor and, to their 
intense relief, Angelina sought out her team at lunch 
to tell them that Quidditch practice was canceled. 

“Good,” said Harry quietly, when she told him, 
“because we’ve found somewhere to have our first 

Page | 496Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Defense meeting. Tonight, eight o’clock, seventh floor 
opposite that tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy being 
clubbed by those trolls. Can you tell Katie and 
Alicia?” 

She looked slightly taken aback but promised to tell 
the others; Harry returned hungrily to his sausages 
and mash. When he looked up to take a drink of 
pumpkin juice, he found Hermione watching him. 

“What?” he said thickly. 

“Well ... it’s just that Dobby’s plans aren’t always that 
safe. Don’t you remember when he lost you all the 
bones in your arm?” 

“This room isn’t just some mad idea of Dobby’s; 
Dumbledore knows about it too, he mentioned it to 
me at the Yule Ball.” 

Hermione’s expression cleared. 

“Dumbledore told you about it?” 

“Just in passing,” said Harry, shrugging. 

“Oh well, that’s all right then,” said Hermione briskly 
and she raised no more objections. 

Together with Ron they had spent most of the day 
seeking out those people who had signed their names 
to the list in the Hog’s Head and telling them where to 
meet that evening. Somewhat to Harry’s 
disappointment, it was Ginny who managed to find 
Cho Chang and her friend first; however, by the end 
of dinner he was confident that the news had been 
passed to every one of the twenty-five people who had 
turned up in the Hog’s Head. 



Page | 497Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




At half-past seven Harry, Ron, and Hermione left the 
Gryffindor common room, Harry clutching a certain 
piece of aged parchment in his hand. Fifth years were 
allowed to be out in the corridors until nine o’clock, 
but all three of them kept looking around nervously 
as they made their way up to the seventh floor. 

“Hold it,” said Harry warningly, unfolding the piece of 
parchment at the top of the last staircase, tapping it 
with his wand, and muttering, “I solemnly swear that 
I am up to no good.” 

A map of Hogwarts appeared upon the blank surface 
of the parchment. Tiny black moving dots, labeled 
with names, showed where various people were. 

“Filch is on the second floor,” said Harry, holding the 
map close to his eyes and scanning it closely, “and 
Mrs. Norris is on the fourth.” 

“And Umbridge?” said Hermione anxiously. 

“In her office,” said Harry, pointing. “Okay, let’s go.” 

They hurried along the corridor to the place Dobby 
had described to Harry, a stretch of blank wall 
opposite an enormous tapestry depicting Barnabas 
the Barmy’s foolish attempt to train trolls for the 
ballet. 

“Okay,” said Harry quietly, while a moth-eaten troll 
paused in his relentless clubbing of the would-be 
ballet teacher to watch. “Dobby said to walk past this 
bit of wall three times, concentrating hard on what we 
need.” 

They did so, turning sharply at the window just 
beyond the blank stretch of wall, then at the man-size 
vase on its other side. Ron had screwed up his eyes in 

Page | 498Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




concentration, Hermione was whispering something 
under her breath, Harry’s fists were clenched as he 
stared ahead of him. 

We need somewhere to learn to fight... he thought. 

Just give us a place to practice ... somewhere they 
can’t find us ... 

“Harry,” said Hermione sharply, as they wheeled 
around after their third walk past. 

A highly polished door had appeared in the wall. Ron 
was staring at it, looking slightly wary. Harry reached 
out, seized the brass handle, pulled open the door, 
and led the way into a spacious room lit with 
flickering torches like those that illuminated the 
dungeons eight floors below. 

The walls were lined with wooden bookcases, and 
instead of chairs there were large silk cushions on the 
floor. A set of shelves at the far end of the room 
carried a range of instruments such as Sneakoscopes, 
Secrecy Sensors, and a large, cracked Foe-Glass that 
Harry was sure had hung, the previous year, in the 
fake Moody’s office. 

“These will be good when we’re practicing Stunning,” 
said Ron enthusiastically, prodding one of the 
cushions with his foot. 

“And just look at these books!” said Hermione 
excitedly, running a finger along the spines of the 
large leather-bound tomes. “A Compendium of 
Common Curses and Their Counter-Actions ... The 
Dark Arts Outsmarted ... Self-Defensive Spellwork ... 
wow ...” She looked around at Harry, her face 
glowing, and he saw that the presence of hundreds of 
books had finally convinced Hermione that what they 



Page | 499Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




were doing was right. “Harry, this is wonderful, 
there’s everything we need here!” 

And without further ado she slid Jinxes for the Jinxed 
from its shelf, sank onto the nearest cushion, and 
began to read. 

There was a gentle knock on the door. Harry looked 
around; Ginny, Neville, Lavender, Parvati, and Dean 
had arrived. 

“Whoa,” said Dean, staring around, impressed. “What 
is this place?” 

Harry began to explain, but before he had finished 
more people had arrived, and he had to start all over 
again. By the time eight o’clock arrived, every cushion 
was occupied. Harry moved across to the door and 
turned the key protruding from the lock; it clicked in 
a satisfyingly loud way and everybody fell silent, 
looking at him. Hermione carefully marked her page 
of Jinxes for the Jinxed and set the book aside. 

“Well,” said Harry, slightly nervously. “This is the 
place we’ve found for practices, and you’ve — er — 
obviously found it okay — ” 

“It’s fantastic!” said Cho, and several people 
murmured their agreement. 

“It’s bizarre,” said Fred, frowning around at it. “We 
once hid from Filch in here, remember, George? But it 
was just a broom cupboard then...” 

“Hey, Harry, what’s this stuff?” asked Dean from the 
rear of the room, indicating the Sneakoscopes and the 
Foe-Glass. 



Page | 500Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Dark Detectors,” said Harry, stepping between the 
cushions to reach them. “Basically they all show 
when Dark wizards or enemies are around, but you 
don’t want to rely on them too much, they can be 
fooled...” 

He gazed for a moment into the cracked Foe-Glass; 
shadowy figures were moving around inside it, though 
none was recognizable. He turned his back on it. 

“Well, I’ve been thinking about the sort of stuff we 
ought to do first and — er — ” He noticed a raised 
hand. “What, Hermione?” 

“I think we ought to elect a leader,” said Hermione. 

“Harry’s leader,” said Cho at once, looking at 
Hermione as though she were mad, and Harry’s 
stomach did yet another back flip. 

“Yes, but I think we ought to vote on it properly,” said 
Hermione, unperturbed. “It makes it formal and it 
gives him authority. So — everyone who thinks Harry 
ought to be our leader?” 

Everybody put up their hands, even Zacharias Smith, 
though he did it very halfheartedly. 

“Er — right, thanks,” said Harry, who could feel his 
face burning. “And — what, Hermione?” 

“I also think we ought to have a name,” she said 
brightly, her hand still in the air. “It would promote a 
feeling of team spirit and unity, don’t you think?” 

“Can we be the Anti-Umbridge League?” said Angelina 
hopefully. 



Page | 501Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Or the Ministry of Magic Are Morons Group?” 
suggested Fred. 

“I was thinking,” said Hermione, frowning at Fred, 
“more of a name that didn’t tell everyone what we 
were up to, so we can refer to it safely outside 
meetings.” 

“The Defense Association?” said Cho. “The D.A. for 
short, so nobody knows what we’re talking about?” 

“Yeah, the D.A.’s good,” said Ginny. “Only let’s make 
it stand for Dumbledore’s Army because that’s the 
Ministry’s worst fear, isn’t it?” 

There was a good deal of appreciative murmuring and 
laughter at this. 

“All in favor of the D.A.?” said Hermione bossily, 
kneeling up on her cushion to count. “That’s a 
majority — motion passed!” 

She pinned the piece of paper with all of their names 
on it on the wall and wrote DUMBLEDORE’S ARMY 
across the top in large letters. 

“Right,” said Harry, when she had sat down again, 
“shall we get practicing then? I was thinking, the first 
thing we should do is Expelliarmus, you know, the 
Disarming Charm. I know it’s pretty basic but I’ve 
found it really useful — ” 

“Oh please,” said Zacharias Smith, rolling his eyes 
and folding his arms. “I don’t think Expelliarmus is 
exactly going to help us against You-Know-Who, do 
you?” 

“I’ve used it against him,” said Harry quietly. “It saved 
my life last June.” 

Page | 502Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Smith opened his mouth stupidly. The rest of the 
room was very quiet. 

“But if you think it’s beneath you, you can leave,” 
Harry said. 

Smith did not move. Nor did anybody else. 

“Okay,” said Harry, his mouth slightly drier than 
usual with all those eyes upon him, “I reckon we 
should all divide into pairs and practice.” 

It felt very odd to be issuing instructions, but not 
nearly as odd as seeing them followed. Everybody got 
to their feet at once and divided up. Predictably, 
Neville was left partnerless. 

“You can practice with me,” Harry told him. “Right — 
on the count of three, then — one, two, three — ” 

The room was suddenly full of shouts of 
“Expelliarmusl”: Wands flew in all directions, missed 
spells hit books on shelves and sent them flying into 
the air. Harry was too quick for Neville, whose wand 
went spinning out of his hand, hit the ceiling in a 
shower of sparks, and landed with a clatter on top of 
a bookshelf, from which Harry retrieved it with a 
Summoning Charm. Glancing around he thought he 
had been right to suggest that they practice the 
basics first; there was a lot of shoddy spellwork going 
on; many people were not succeeding in disarming 
their opponents at all, but merely causing them to 
jump backward a few paces or wince as the feeble 
spell whooshed over them. 

“Expelliarmusl” said Neville, and Harry, caught 
unawares, felt his wand fly out of his hand. 



Page | 503Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“I DID IT!” said Neville gleefully. “I’ve never done it 
before — I DID IT!” 



“Good one!” said Harry encouragingly, deciding not to 
point out that in a real duel situation Neville’s 
opponent was unlikely to be staring in the opposite 
direction with his wand held loosely at his side. 
“Listen, Neville, can you take it in turns to practice 
with Ron and Hermione for a couple of minutes so I 
can walk around and see how the rest are doing?” 

Harry moved off into the middle of the room. 
Something very odd was happening to Zacharias 
Smith; every time he opened his mouth to disarm 
Anthony Goldstein, his own wand would fly out of his 
hand, yet Anthony did not seem to be making a 
sound. Harry did not have to look far for the solution 
of the mystery, however; Fred and George were 
several feet from Smith and taking it in turns to point 
their wands at his back. 

“Sorry, Harry,” said George hastily, when Harry 
caught his eye. “Couldn’t resist ...” 

Harry walked around the other pairs, trying to correct 
those who were doing the spell wrong. Ginny was 
teamed with Michael Corner; she was doing very well, 
whereas Michael was either very bad or unwilling to 
jinx her. Ernie Macmillan was flourishing his wand 
unnecessarily, giving his partner time to get in under 
his guard; the Creevey brothers were enthusiastic but 
erratic and mainly responsible for all the books 
leaping off the shelves around them. Luna Lovegood 
was similarly patchy, occasionally sending Justin 
Finch-Fletchley’s wand spinning out of his hand, at 
other times merely causing his hair to stand on end. 

“Okay, stop!” Harry shouted. “Stop\ STOP.” 

Page | 504Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




I need a whistle, he thought, and immediately spotted 
one lying on top of the nearest row of books. He 
caught it up and blew hard. Everyone lowered their 
wands. 

“That wasn’t bad,” said Harry, “but there’s definite 
room for improvement.” Zacharias Smith glared at 
him. “Let’s try again...” 

He moved off around the room again, stopping here 
and there to make suggestions. Slowly the general 
performance improved. He avoided going near Cho 
and her friend for a while, but after walking twice 
around every other pair in the room felt he could not 
ignore them any longer. 

“Oh no,” said Cho rather wildly as he approached. 

“ Expelliarmiousl I mean, Exnellimellius\ I — oh, sorry, 
Marietta!” 

Her curly-haired friend’s sleeve had caught fire; 
Marietta extinguished it with her own wand and 
glared at Harry as though it was his fault. 

“You made me nervous, I was doing all right before 
then!” Cho told Harry ruefully. 

“That was quite good,” Harry lied, but when she 
raised her eyebrows he said, “Well, no, it was lousy, 
but I know you can do it properly, I was watching 
from over there...” 

She laughed. Her friend Marietta looked at them 
rather sourly and turned away. 

“Don’t mind her,” Cho muttered. “She doesn’t really 
want to be here but I made her come with me. Her 
parents have forbidden her to do anything that might 



Page | 505Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




upset Umbridge, you see — her mum works for the 
Ministry.” 

“What about your parents?” asked Harry. 

“Well, they’ve forbidden me to get on the wrong side of 
Umbridge too,” said Cho, drawing herself up proudly. 
“But if they think I’m not going to fight You-Know- 
Who after what happened to Cedric — ” 

She broke off, looking rather confused, and an 
awkward silence fell between them; Terry Boot’s wand 
went whizzing past Harry’s ear and hit Alicia Spinnet 
hard on the nose. 

“Well, my father is very supportive of any anti- 
Ministry action!” said Luna Lovegood proudly from 
just behind Harry; evidently she had been 
eavesdropping on his conversation while Justin 
Finch-Fletchley attempted to disentangle himself from 
the robes that had flown up over his head. “He’s 
always saying he’d believe anything of Fudge, I mean, 
the number of goblins Fudge has had assassinated! 
And of course he uses the Department of Mysteries to 
develop terrible poisons, which he feeds secretly to 
anybody who disagrees with him. And then there’s his 
Umgubular Slashkilter — ” 

“Don’t ask,” Harry muttered to Cho as she opened her 
mouth, looking puzzled. She giggled. 

“Hey, Harry,” Hermione called from the other end of 
the room, “have you checked the time?” 

He looked down at his watch and received a shock — 
it was already ten past nine, which meant they 
needed to get back to their common rooms 
immediately or risk being caught and punished by 
Filch for being out-of-bounds. He blew his whistle; 
Page | 506Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




everybody stopped shouting, “ Expelliarmusl” and the 
last couple of wands clattered to the floor. 

“Well, that was pretty good,” said Harry, “but we’ve 
overrun, we’d better leave it here. Same time, same 
place next week?” 

“Sooner!” said Dean Thomas eagerly and many people 
nodded in agreement. 

Angelina, however, said quickly, “The Quidditch 
season’s about to start, we need team practices too!” 

“Let’s say next Wednesday night, then,” said Harry, 
“and we can decide on additional meetings then... 
Come on, we’d better get going...” 

He pulled out the Marauder’s Map again and checked 
it carefully for signs of teachers on the seventh floor. 
He let them all leave in threes and fours, watching 
their tiny dots anxiously to see that they returned 
safely to their dormitories: the Hufflepuffs to the 
basement corridor that also led to the kitchens, the 
Ravenclaws to a tower on the west side of the castle, 
and the Gryffindors along the corridor to the seventh 
floor and the Fat Lady’s portrait. 

“That was really, really good, Harry,” said Hermione, 
when finally it was just her, Harry, and Ron left. 

“Yeah, it was!” said Ron enthusiastically, as they 
slipped out of the door and watched it melt back into 
stone behind them. “Did you see me disarm 
Hermione, Harry?” 

“Only once,” said Hermione, stung. “I got you loads 
more than you got me — ” 



Page | 507Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“I did not only get you once, I got you at least three 
times — ” 

“Well, if you’re counting the one where you tripped 
over your own feet and knocked the wand out of my 
hand — ” 

They argued all the way back to the common room, 
but Harry was not listening to them. He had one eye 
on the Marauder’s Map, but he was also thinking of 
how Cho had said he made her nervous... 



Page | 508Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 






THE LION AND THE SERPENT 

Harry felt as though he were carrying some kind of 
talisman inside his chest over the following two 
weeks, a glowing secret that supported him through 
Umbridge’s classes and even made it possible for him 
to smile blandly as he looked into her horrible bulging 
eyes. He and the D.A. were resisting her under her 
very nose, doing the very thing that she and the 
Ministry most feared, and whenever he was supposed 
to be reading Wilbert Slinkhard’s book during her 
lessons he dwelled instead on satisfying memories of 
their most recent meetings, remembering how Neville 
had successfully disarmed Hermione, how Colin 
Creevey had mastered the Impediment Jinx after 
three meetings’ hard effort, how Parvati Patil had 
produced such a good Reductor Curse that she had 
reduced the table carrying all the Sneakoscopes to 
dust. 

He was finding it almost impossible to fix a regular 
night of the week for D.A. meetings, as they had to 
accommodate three separate Quidditch teams’ 
practices, which were often rearranged depending on 

Page | 509Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 



the weather conditions; but Harry was not sorry 
about this, he had a feeling that it was probably 
better to keep the timing of their meetings 
unpredictable. If anyone was watching them, it would 
be hard to make out a pattern. 

Hermione soon devised a very clever method of 
communicating the time and date of the next meeting 
to all the members in case they needed to change it at 
short notice, because it would look so suspicious if 
people from different Houses were seen crossing the 
Great Hall to talk to each other too often. She gave 
each of the members of the D.A. a fake Galleon (Ron 
became very excited when he saw the basket at first, 
convinced that she was actually giving out gold). 

“You see the numerals around the edge of the coins?” 
Hermione said, holding one up for examination at the 
end of their fourth meeting. The coin gleamed fat and 
yellow in the light from the torches. “On real Galleons 
that’s just a serial number referring to the goblin who 
cast the coin. On these fake coins, though, the 
numbers will change to reflect the time and date of 
the next meeting. The coins will grow hot when the 
date changes, so if you’re carrying them in a pocket 
you’ll be able to feel them. We take one each, and 
when Harry sets the date of the next meeting he’ll 
change the numbers on his coin, and because I’ve put 
a Protean Charm on them, they’ll all change to mimic 
his.” 

A blank silence greeted Hermione ’s words. She looked 
around at all the faces upturned to her, rather 
disconcerted. 

“Well — I thought it was a good idea,” she said 
uncertainly, “I mean, even if Umbridge asked us to 
turn out our pockets, there’s nothing fishy about 



Page | 510Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




carrying a Galleon, is there? But ... well, if you don’t 
want to use them ...” 

“You can do a Protean Charm?” said Terry Boot. 

“Yes,” said Hermione. 

“But that’s ... that’s N.E.W.T. standard, that is,” he 
said weakly. 

“Oh,” said Hermione, trying to look modest. “Oh ... 
well ... yes, I suppose it is...” 

“How come you’re not in Ravenclaw?” he demanded, 
staring at Hermione with something close to wonder. 
“With brains like yours?” 

“Well, the Sorting Hat did seriously consider putting 
me in Ravenclaw during my Sorting,” said Hermione 
brightly, “but it decided on Gryffindor in the end. So 
does that mean we’re using the Galleons?” 

There was a murmur of assent and everybody moved 
forward to collect one from the basket. Harry looked 
sideways at Hermione. 

“You know what these remind me of?” 

“No, what’s that?” 

“The Death Eaters’ scars. Voldemort touches one of 
them, and all their scars burn, and they know they’ve 
got to join him.” 

“Well ... yes,” said Hermione quietly. “That is where I 
got the idea ... but you’ll notice I decided to engrave 
the date on bits of metal rather than on our members’ 
skin...” 



Page | 511Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Yeah ... I prefer your way,” said Harry, grinning, as 
he slipped his Galleon into his pocket. “I suppose the 
only danger with these is that we might accidentally 
spend them.” 

“Fat chance,” said Ron, who was examining his own 
fake Galleon with a slightly mournful air. “I haven’t 
got any real Galleons to confuse it with.” 

As the first Quidditch match of the season, Gryffindor 
versus Slytherin, drew nearer, their D.A. meetings 
were put on hold because Angelina insisted on almost 
daily practices. The fact that the Quidditch Cup had 
not been held for so long added considerably to the 
interest and excitement surrounding the forthcoming 
game. The Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs were taking a 
lively interest in the outcome, for they, of course, 
would be playing both teams over the coming year; 
and the Heads of House of the competing teams, 
though they attempted to disguise it under a decent 
pretense of sportsmanship, were determined to see 
their side’s victory. Harry realized how much 
Professor McGonagall cared about beating Slytherin 
when she abstained from giving them homework in 
the week leading up to the match. 

“I think you’ve got enough to be getting on with at the 
moment,” she said loftily. Nobody could quite believe 
their ears until she looked directly at Harry and Ron 
and said grimly, “I’ve become accustomed to seeing 
the Quidditch Cup in my study, boys, and I really 
don’t want to have to hand it over to Professor Snape, 
so use the extra time to practice, won’t you?” 

Snape was no less obviously partisan: He had booked 
the Quidditch pitch for Slytherin practice so often 
that the Gryffindors had difficulty getting on it to 
play. He was also turning a deaf ear to the many 
reports of Slytherin attempts to hex Gryffindor 
Page | 512Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




players in the corridors. When Alicia Spinnet turned 
up in the hospital wing with her eyebrows growing so 
thick and fast that they obscured her vision and 
obstructed her mouth, Snape insisted that she must 
have attempted a Hair-Thickening Charm on herself 
and refused to listen to the fourteen eyewitnesses who 
insisted that they had seen the Slytherin Keeper, 

Miles Bletchley, hit her from behind with a jinx while 
she worked in the library. 

Harry felt optimistic about Gryffindor’s chances; they 
had, after all, never lost to Malfoy’s team. Admittedly 
Ron was still not performing to Wood’s standard, but 
he was working extremely hard to improve. His 
greatest weakness was a tendency to lose confidence 
when he made a blunder; if he let in one goal he 
became flustered and was therefore likely to miss 
more. On the other hand, Harry had seen Ron make 
some truly spectacular saves when he was on form: 
During one memorable practice, he had hung one- 
handed from his broom and kicked the Quaffle so 
hard away from the goal hoop that it soared the 
length of the pitch and through the center hoop at the 
other end. The rest of the team felt this save 
compared favorably with one made recently by Barry 
Ryan, the Irish International Keeper, against Poland’s 
top Chaser, Ladislaw Zamojski. Even Fred had said 
that Ron might yet make him and George proud, and 
that they were seriously considering admitting that he 
was related to them, something he assured Ron they 
had been trying to deny for four years. 

The only thing really worrying Harry was how much 
Ron was allowing the tactics of the Slytherin team to 
upset him before they even got onto the pitch. Harry, 
of course, had endured their snide comments for 
more than four years, so whispers of, “Hey, Potty, I 
heard Warrington’s sworn to knock you off your 
broom on Saturday,” far from chilling his blood, made 
Page | 513Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




him laugh. “Warrington’s aim’s so pathetic I’d be 
more worried if he was aiming for the person next to 
me,” he retorted, which made Ron and Hermione 
laugh and wiped the smirk off Pansy Parkinson’s face. 

But Ron had never endured a relentless campaign of 
insults, jeers, and intimidation. When Slytherins, 
some of them seventh years and considerably larger 
than he was, muttered as they passed in the 
corridors, “Got your bed booked in the hospital wing, 
Weasley?” he did not laugh, but turned a delicate 
shade of green. When Draco Malfoy imitated Ron 
dropping the Quaffle (which he did whenever they 
were within sight of each other), Ron’s ears glowed 
red and his hands shook so badly that he was likely 
to drop whatever he was holding at the time too. 

October extinguished itself in a rush of howling winds 
and driving rain and November arrived, cold as frozen 
iron, with hard frosts every morning and icy drafts 
that bit at exposed hands and faces. The skies and 
the ceiling of the Great Hall turned a pale, pearly 
gray, the mountains around Hogwarts became 
snowcapped, and the temperature in the castle 
dropped so far that many students wore their thick 
protective dragon skin gloves in the corridors between 
lessons. 

The morning of the match dawned bright and cold. 
When Harry awoke he looked around at Ron’s bed 
and saw him sitting bolt upright, his arms around his 
knees, staring fixedly into space. 

“You all right?” said Harry. 

Ron nodded but did not speak. Harry was reminded 
forcibly of the time that Ron had accidentally put a 
slug- vomiting charm on himself. He looked just as 



Page | 514Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




pale and sweaty as he had done then, not to mention 
as reluctant to open his mouth. 



“You just need some breakfast,” Harry said bracingly. 
“C’mon.” 

The Great Hall was filling up fast when they arrived, 
the talk louder and the mood more exuberant than 
usual. As they passed the Slytherin table there was 
an upsurge of noise; Harry looked around and saw 
that nearly everyone there was wearing, in addition to 
the usual green-and-silver scarves and hats, silver 
badges in the shape of what seemed to be crowns. For 
some reason many of them waved at Ron, laughing 
uproariously. Harry tried to see what was written on 
the badges as he walked by, but he was too 
concerned to get Ron past their table quickly to linger 
long enough to read them. 

They received a rousing welcome at the Gryffindor 
table, where everyone was wearing red and gold, but 
far from raising Ron’s spirits the cheers seemed to 
sap the last of his morale; he collapsed onto the 
nearest bench looking as though he were facing his 
final meal. 

“I must’ve been mental to do this,” he said in a croaky 
whisper. “Mental.” 

“Don’t be thick,” said Harry firmly, passing him a 
choice of cereals. “You’re going to be fine. It’s normal 
to be nervous.” 

“I’m rubbish,” croaked Ron. “I’m lousy. I can’t play to 
save my life. What was I thinking?” 

“Get a grip,” said Harry sternly. “Look at that save 
you made with your foot the other day, even Fred and 
George said it was brilliant — ” 

Page | 515Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Ron turned a tortured face to Harry. 



“That was an accident,” he whispered miserably. “I 
didn’t mean to do it — I slipped off my broom when 
none of you were looking and I was trying to get back 
on and I kicked the Quaffle by accident.” 

“Well,” said Harry, recovering quickly from this 
unpleasant surprise, “a few more accidents like that 
and the game’s in the bag, isn’t it?” 

Hermione and Ginny sat down opposite them wearing 
red-and-gold scarves, gloves, and rosettes. 

“How’re you feeling?” Ginny asked Ron, who was now 
staring into the dregs of milk at the bottom of his 
empty cereal bowl as though seriously considering 
attempting to drown himself in them. 

“He’s just nervous,” said Harry. 

“Well, that’s a good sign, I never feel you perform as 
well in exams if you’re not a bit nervous,” said 
Hermione heartily. 

“Hello,” said a vague and dreamy voice from behind 
them. Harry looked up: Luna Lovegood had drifted 
over from the Ravenclaw table. Many people were 
staring at her and a few openly laughing and 
pointing; she had managed to procure a hat shaped 
like a life-size lion’s head, which was perched 
precariously on her head. 

“I’m supporting Gryffindor,” said Luna, pointing 
unnecessarily at her hat. “Look what it does...” 

She reached up and tapped the hat with her wand. It 
opened its mouth wide and gave an extremely realistic 
roar that made everyone in the vicinity jump. 

Page | 516Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“It’s good, isn’t it?” said Luna happily. “I wanted to 
have it chewing up a serpent to represent Slytherin, 
you know, but there wasn’t time. Anyway ... good 
luck, Ronald!” 

She drifted away. They had not quite recovered from 
the shock of Luna’s hat before Angelina came 
hurrying toward them, accompanied by Katie and 
Alicia, whose eyebrows had mercifully been returned 
to normal by Madam Pomfrey. 

“When you’re ready,” she said, “we’re going to go 
straight down to the pitch, check out conditions and 
change.” 

“We’ll be there in a bit,” Harry assured her. “Ron’s 
just got to have some breakfast.” 

It became clear after ten minutes, however, that Ron 
was not capable of eating anything more and Harry 
thought it best to get him down to the changing 
rooms. As they rose from the table, Hermione got up 
too, and taking Harry’s arm, she drew him to one 
side. 

“Don’t let Ron see what’s on those Slytherins’ 
badges,” she whispered urgently. 

Harry looked questioningly at her, but she shook her 
head warningly; Ron had just ambled over to them, 
looking lost and desperate. 

“Good luck, Ron,” said Hermione, standing on tiptoe 
and kissing him on the cheek. “And you, Harry — ” 

Ron seemed to come to himself slightly as they 
walked back across the Great Hall. He touched the 
spot on his face where Hermione had kissed him, 
looking puzzled, as though he was not quite sure 

Page | 517Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




what had just happened. He seemed too distracted to 
notice much around him, but Harry cast a curious 
glance at the crown-shaped badges as they passed 
the Slytherin table, and this time he made out the 
words etched onto them: 

WEASLEY 

IS OUR KING 

With an unpleasant feeling that this could mean 
nothing good, he hurried Ron across the entrance 
hall, down the stone steps, and out into the icy air. 

The frosty grass crunched under their feet as they 
hurried down the sloping lawns toward the stadium. 
There was no wind at all and the sky was a uniform 
pearly white, which meant that visibility would be 
good without the drawback of direct sunlight in the 
eyes. Harry pointed out these encouraging factors to 
Ron as they walked, but he was not sure that Ron 
was listening. 

Angelina had changed already and was talking to the 
rest of the team when they entered. Harry and Ron 
pulled on their robes (Ron attempted to do his up 
back-to-front for several minutes before Alicia took 
pity on him and went to help) and then sat down to 
listen to the pre-match talk while the babble of voices 
outside grew steadily louder as the crowd came 
pouring out of the castle toward the pitch. 

“Okay, Eve only just found out the final lineup for 
Slytherin,” said Angelina, consulting a piece of 
parchment. “Last year’s Beaters, Derrick and Bole, 
have left now, but it looks as though Montague’s 
replaced them with the usual gorillas, rather than 
anyone who can fly particularly well. They’re two 



Page | 518Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




blokes called Crabbe and Goyle, I don’t know much 
about them — ” 

“We do,” said Harry and Ron together. 

“Well, they don’t look bright enough to tell one end of 
a broom from another,” said Angelina, pocketing her 
parchment, “but then I was always surprised Derrick 
and Bole managed to find their way onto the pitch 
without signposts.” 

“Crabbe and Goyle are in the same mold,” Harry 
assured her. 

They could hear hundreds of footsteps mounting the 
banked benches of the spectators’ stands now. Some 
people were singing, though Harry could not make 
out the words. He was starting to feel nervous, but he 
knew his butterflies were as nothing to Ron’s, who 
was clutching his stomach and staring straight ahead 
again, his jaw set and his complexion pale gray. 

“It’s time,” said Angelina in a hushed voice, looking at 
her watch. “C’mon everyone ... good luck.” 

The team rose, shouldered their brooms, and 
marched in single file out of the changing room and 
into the dazzling sunlight. A roar of sound greeted 
them in which Harry could still hear singing, though 
it was muffled by the cheers and whistles. 

The Slytherin team were standing waiting for them. 
They too were wearing those silver crown-shaped 
badges. The new captain, Montague, was built along 
the same lines as Dudley, with massive forearms like 
hairy hams. Behind him lurked Crabbe and Goyle, 
almost as large, blinking stupidly in the sunlight, 
swinging their new Beaters’ bats. Malfoy stood to one 
side, the sunlight gleaming on his white-blond head. 
Page | 519Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




He caught Harry’s eye and smirked, tapping the 
crown-shaped badge on his chest. 

“Captains shake hands,” ordered the umpire, Madam 
Hooch, as Angelina and Montague reached each 
other. Harry could tell that Montague was trying to 
crush Angelina’s fingers, though she did not wince. 
“Mount your brooms...” 

Madam Hooch placed her whistle in her mouth and 
blew. 

The balls were released and the fourteen players shot 
upward; out of the corner of his eye Harry saw Ron 
streak off toward the goal hoops. He zoomed higher, 
dodging a Bludger, and set off on a wide lap of the 
pitch, gazing around for a glint of gold; on the other 
side of the stadium, Draco Malfoy was doing exactly 
the same. 

“And it’s Johnson, Johnson with the Quaffle, what a 
player that girl is, I’ve been saying it for years but she 
still won’t go out with me — ” 

“JORDAN!” yelled Professor McGonagall. 

“Just a fun fact, Professor, adds a bit of interest — 
and she’s ducked Warrington, she’s passed 
Montague, she’s — ouch — been hit from behind by a 
Bludger from Crabbe... Montague catches the Quaffle, 
Montague heading back up the pitch and — nice 
Bludger there from George Weasley, that’s a Bludger 
to the head for Montague, he drops the Quaffle, 
caught by Katie Bell, Katie Bell of Gryffindor reverse 
passes to Alicia Spinnet and Spinnet’s away — ” 

Lee Jordan’s commentary rang through the stadium 
and Harry listened as hard as he could through the 



Page | 520Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




wind whistling in his ears and the din of the crowd, 
all yelling and booing and singing — 

“ — dodges Warrington, avoids a Bludger — close call, 
Alicia — and the crowd are loving this, just listen to 
them, what’s that they’re singing?” 

And as Lee paused to listen the song rose loud and 
clear from the sea of green and silver in the Slytherin 
section of the stands: 

Weasley cannot save a thing, 

He cannot block a single ring, 

That’s why Slytherins all sing: 

Weasley is our King. 

Weasley was born in a bin, 

He always lets the Quaffle in, 

Weasley will make sure we win, 

Weasley is our King. 

“ — and Alicia passes back to Angelina!” Lee shouted, 
and as Harry swerved, his insides boiling at what he 
had just heard, he knew Lee was trying to drown out 
the sound of the singing. “Come on now, Angelina — 
looks like she’s got just the Keeper to beat! — SHE 
SHOOTS — SHE — aaaah ...” 

Bletchley, the Slytherin Keeper, had saved the goal; 
he threw the Quaffle to Warrington who sped off with 
it, zigzagging in between Alicia and Katie; the singing 
from below grew louder and louder as he drew nearer 
and nearer Ron — 

Weasley is our King, 

Weasley is our King, 

He always lets the Quaffle in, 

Weasley is our King. 



Page | 521Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Harry could not help himself: Abandoning his search 
for the Snitch, he turned his Firebolt toward Ron, a 
lone figure at the far end of the pitch, hovering before 
the three goal hoops while the massive Warrington 
pelted toward him ... 

“ — and it’s Warrington with the Quaffle, Warrington 
heading for goal, he’s out of Bludger range with just 
the Keeper ahead — ” 

A great swell of song rose from the Slytherin stands 
below: 

Weasley cannot save a thing, 

He cannot block a single ring . . . 

“ — so it’s the first test for new Gryffindor Keeper, 
Weasley, brother of Beaters, Fred and George, and a 
promising new talent on the team — come on, Ron!” 

But the scream of delight came from the Slytherin 
end: Ron had dived wildly, his arms wide, and the 
Quaffle had soared between them, straight through 
Ron’s central hoop. 

“Slytherin score!” came Lee’s voice amid the cheering 
and booing from the crowds below. “So that’s ten-nil 
to Slytherin — bad luck, Ron ...” 

The Slytherins sang even louder: 

WEASLEY WAS BORN IN A BIN, 

HE ALWAYS LETS THE QUAFFLE IN ... 

“ — and Gryffindor back in possession and it’s Katie 
Bell tanking up the pitch — ” cried Lee valiantly, 
though the singing was now so deafening that he 
could hardly make himself heard above it. 



Page | 522Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




WEASLEY WILL MAKE SURE WE WIN, 

WEASLEY IS OUR KING . . . 

“Harry, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?” screamed Angelina, 
soaring past him to keep up with Katie. “GET 
GOING!” 

Harry realized that he had been stationary in midair 
for more than a minute, watching the progress of the 
match without sparing a thought for the whereabouts 
of the Snitch; horrified, he went into a dive and 
started circling the pitch again, staring around, trying 
to ignore the chorus now thundering through the 
stadium: 

WEASLEY IS OUR KING, 

WEASLEY IS OUR KING . . . 

There was no sign of the Snitch anywhere he looked; 
Malfoy was still circling the stadium just like Harry. 
They passed midway around the pitch going in 
opposite directions and Harry heard Malfoy singing 
loudly, 

WEASLEY WAS BORN IN A BIN . . . 

“ — and it’s Warrington again,” bellowed Lee, “who 
passes to Pucey, Pucey’s off past Spinnet, come on 
now Angelina, you can take him — turns out you 
can’t — but nice Bludger from Fred Weasley, I mean, 
George Weasley, oh who cares, one of them anyway, 
and Warrington drops the Quaffle and Katie Bell — er 
— drops it too — so that’s Montague with the Quaffle, 
Slytherin Captain Montague takes the Quaffle, and 
he’s off up the pitch, come on now Gryffindor, block 
him!” 

Harry zoomed around the end of the stadium behind 
the Slytherin goal hoops, willing himself not to look at 

Page | 523 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




what was going on at Ron’s end; as he sped past the 
Slytherin Keeper, he heard Bletchley singing along 
with the crowd below, 

WEASLEY CANNOT SAVE A THING . . . 

“ — and Pucey’s dodged Alicia again, and he’s heading 
straight for goal, stop it, Ron!” 

Harry did not have to look to see what had happened: 
There was a terrible groan from the Gryffindor end, 
coupled with fresh screams and applause from the 
Slytherins. Looking down, Harry saw the pug-faced 
Pansy Parkinson right at the front of the stands, her 
back to the pitch as she conducted the Slytherin 
supporters who were roaring: 

THAT’S WHY SLYTHERINS ALL SING: 

WEASLEY IS OUR KING. 

But twenty-nil was nothing, there was still time for 
Gryffindor to catch up or catch the Snitch, a few goals 
and they would be in the lead as usual, Harry 
assured himself, bobbing and weaving through the 
other players in pursuit of something shiny that 
turned out to be Montague’s watch strap... 

But Ron let in two more goals. There was an edge of 
panic in Harry’s desire to find the Snitch now. If he 
could just get it soon and finish the game quickly ... 

“ — and Katie Bell of Gryffindor dodges Pucey, ducks 
Montague, nice swerve, Katie, and she throws to 
Johnson, Angelina Johnson takes the Quaffle, she’s 
past Warrington, she’s heading for goal, come on now 
Angelina — GRYFFINDOR SCORE! It’s forty-ten, forty- 
ten to Slytherin and Pucey has the Quaffle...”
